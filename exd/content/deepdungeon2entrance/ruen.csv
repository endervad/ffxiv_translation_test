You may enter Heaven<var 1F /var>on<var 1F /var>High solo or in a party of up to four players. When speaking with Kyusei, you will be given the option to enter with a fixed party or a matched party via the matching system.

It is possible to receive a score for your performance in Heaven<var 1F /var>on<var 1F /var>High. In order to do so, you must enter with a fixed party.

It is possible to convert fixed party save data to matched party save data, allowing you to be matched automatically with other players via the matching system. Please note that all special items (pomanders) will be lost upon converting your data.

Empyrean aetherpool gear can be enhanced by accessing silver coffers. These coffers are found randomly on each floor and after defeating certain enemies.
