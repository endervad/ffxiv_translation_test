In those days, Emont would recycle unneeded or damaged rigging and sell it for other ships to use for repairs or reinforcements. Though the ice and cold have stopped the ships from reaching him, he plans to prepare for the day the rivers melt by having plenty of rigging prepared for sale.","TEXT_HEAVNZ620_01888_SEQ_03<tab>Emont vous a <var 08 E905 ((remerciée)) ((remercié)) /var> et vous a expliqué ce sur quoi il travaillait.

Bien que la glace et le froid empêchent désormais les vaisseaux d'arriver jusqu'à lui, il voudrait avoir une bonne réserve de gréements prêts à la vente pour pouvoir reprendre les affaires à la fonte des glaces.","","False","0x00000003","",""
