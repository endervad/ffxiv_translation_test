Though the ice and cold have stopped the ships from reaching him, he plans to prepare for the day the rivers melt by having plenty of rigging prepared for sale.","TEXT_HEAVNZ620_01888_SEQ_03<tab>Emont erzählt dir, was er herstellt: Werg, Kalfatermaterial, um die Nähte zwischen den Schiffsplanken abzudichten.
