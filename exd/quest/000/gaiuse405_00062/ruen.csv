Convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that Iceheart's followers have gone to ground somewhere in the vicinity, Ser Aymeric declares that his Temple Knights will join in the hunt for Iceheart. Not to be outdone, Alphinaud responds that he has already summoned a unit of Crystal Braves to Whitebrim Front for the same purpose. With so formidable a force devoted to the task, the heretics cannot hope to remain hidden for long. Alphinaud, however, would leave nothing to chance, and bids you explore other ways in which Iceheart might be found.","","","False","0x00000002","",""
