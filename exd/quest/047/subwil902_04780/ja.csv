If he had people near him in his final moments, the writer muses, they may be able to provide some insights─and by a fortuitous turn, Baderon, who chances to overhear your conversation, happens to know an individual who served among the Archon's guard at Carteneau. Known by the name of Orn Guincum, this former officer of the Maelstrom has since turned to adventuring, and there is a possibility he is presently at the Moraby Drydocks. Upon learning of this, Nananji immediately sets off, eager not to miss the opportunity to speak with the man.
