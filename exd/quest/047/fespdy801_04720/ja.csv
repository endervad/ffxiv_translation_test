"","TEXT_FESPDY801_04720_SEQ_02<tab>You find Aldiytha downcast, frustrated that she is unable to meet with two people she had arranged appointments with due to her sickly state. Bringing you up to speed, she explains that the plan for this year's celebration came into fruition when she found an antique folding fan in her home, the Thorne manor. After some research, she discovered that a fan of identical design was once used by Princess Edvya more than three centuries ago, when the audacious princess used it to perform a dance. Aldiytha, charmed by the tale, informed the royal seneschal of her desire to replicate the storied fan and incorporate it into the festivities, and so the plan to distribute fans to festival-goers was born. It was at this juncture, however, that the artisan in charge of the reproduction revealed that the fan itself was one of recent make, and not in fact from the era of the Thorne Dynasty. Desperate for answers, and unable to turn to her father, Aldiytha instead arranged to meet with a historian and a reporter with knowledge on the subject. Unable to rise to the occasion, she bids you meet with them in her stead.","TEXT_FESPDY801_04720_SEQ_02<tab>アルディシアと話した。アルディシアに代わり、扇に関する調査の続きを請け負うことになった。ナル回廊のクイックサンドにいる「白髪の史学者」と、アルダネス聖櫃堂前にいる「ミスリルアイの記者」にソーン朝様式の扇を見せ、情報を集めよう。","","False","0x00000002","",""

Eager to deliver the news to Aldiytha, and simultaneously perplexed as to how she is unaware of her own family's legacy, you make for the Gold Court.

One noblewoman─who, in turn, reveals herself to be an old friend of Claudia's─reflects fondly on the time she learned the Little Ladies' Dance, and is inspired to teach it to Aldiytha when she learns of her predicament. Meanwhile, a restless nobleman conversely recalls a bittersweet memory of Claudia─of a time when she performed the Little Ladies' Dance for him during a Little Ladies' Day celebration many years ago, only to collapse from exhaustion. Aldiytha would surely wish to be apprised of your discoveries, and so you make ready to return to the Gold Court once more.","TEXT_FESPDY801_04720_SEQ_05<tab>クラウディアの扇に関する情報収集をした。多くの人に愛されたクラウディアだが、体調を崩しがちだったようだ。ゴールドコートで休む「アルディシア」に伝えよう。","","False","0x00000005","",""

He informs you both that her father, Fortin, has been worried sick about her since she disappeared from the manor, and is presently searching for her in the vicinity of the Ruby Road Exchange.

Aldiytha expresses sympathy for how he feels, and then to his amazement, performs the dance to perfection, bringing him back to a Little Ladies' Day long ago, when Claudia once did the same for him. Moved by his daughter's performance, he at last gives in to her wishes, pledging to serve as her seneschal for the remainder of the celebration─as long as she agrees not to push herself. Grateful for your unending support, Aldiytha offers you a replica of the fan and instructions on how to perform the dance yourself.
