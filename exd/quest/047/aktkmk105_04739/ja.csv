"","TEXT_AKTKMK105_04739_SEQ_03<tab>Even after such a harrowing experience, Mettius regards you and your comrades with disdain. Seeing this, Jullus implores the proud patriot to look beyond the glories of the past and accept the reality of their situation, that the Garlean people might build stronger ties with outsiders and improve their lot. Moved by this heartfelt appeal, Mettius apologizes for his behavior, and resolves to rejoin the talks at Tertium. But the magistrate is not the only one with whom Jullus's words appear to have struck a chord, as Zero bids the soldier explain how he wielded trust so deftly and “bound the magistrate.” Puzzled, Jullus corrects her misconception, and credits his success to the infectious nature of trust. “When someone believes in you, it makes you want to believe in them. In others. In yourself.”

Zero recalls a moment from her own past when a mage and knight once implored her to trust in them and join in their fight to end the Contramemoria. Alas, she could not bring herself to do so, and instead refused them outright. Though she fears she may lack the capacity to place her faith in another, Jullus states that what she could not do yesterday, she may yet do today─that so long as we yet live, there is cause to hope. For has she not already learned to forge bonds with you and your comrades? And a friend by any other name would be as deserving of trust. Thus does Jullus extend his hand to her in friendship, and reaffirm that he regards her as a comrade.","TEXT_AKTKMK105_04739_SEQ_03<tab>メッティウスを救助したところにユルスたちも戻り、ゼロは人と信頼を結ぶことについて思うところを話してくれた。ウルバニッシマ区で、友とは何かを知った「ゼロ」と話そう。","","False","0x00000003","",""
