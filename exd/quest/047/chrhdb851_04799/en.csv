Once more did I set aside the Case of the Silent Correspondent to divert my inspectorial energies to more urgent matters─namely, the restoration of the ailing Master PuPu back to health. Laid low by a common cold, his unearthly physiology called for uncommon treatment, yet I, Hildibrand Helidor Maximilian Manderville, did not shy from the challenge! Our extraterrestrial comrade thus restored (and an ambush by the incorrigible villain Doctor Lugae soundly thwarted), I resolved to resume the investigation in the scholarly city of Sharlayan. There did we learn a most heartening thing: Master PuPu's comrade was alive and well, and in the company of a Hannish alchemist. Such news was almost overshadowed, however, by the stunning secret revealed by Father's sought-after relic: the progenitor of the Manderville line was, himself, a being of alien origin! Will this change how I, a gentlemanly agent of enquiry, approach my investigations? Decidedly not!
