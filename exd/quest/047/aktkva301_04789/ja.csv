Thus did Kalika brave the ocean waves to seek a hunter brave and true─a hero he proclaims to be none other than Matsya. Matsya, unsurprisingly, begs to differ, and entreats you to accompany him on an expedition to Aloalo. You agree, and so Pasasun goes to charter a boat that will deliver you to the island, and bids you meet him in Yedlihmad once you are ready to depart.","TEXT_AKTKVA301_04789_SEQ_02<tab>パサスーンたちと話した。マトシャとともにアロアロ島へ行くことになった。サベネア島のイェドリマンで「パサスーン」と再度話そう。","","False","0x00000002","",""
