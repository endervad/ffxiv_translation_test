She admits that this year's vision was rather peculiar because it featured tonberries, creatures of myth known less for their seasonal whimsy and more for their habit of mercilessly stabbing things. This dream proved prophetic indeed, when sylphs descended upon Gridania, dismantling decorations, harassing residents, and otherwise making a nuisance of themselves. These mischievous creatures are deathly afraid of the tonberries' wilting (yet adorable?) gaze, and with the help of a self-proclaimed tonberry connoisseur named Hamlyn, Jihli Aliapoh's volunteers have donned tonberry costumes to scare off the sylphs.
