Although the operation failed to halt Dalamud's descent, it served to demonstrate to the people of Eorzea that, by standing together, they could oppose even the might of the Empire. And at Louisoix's behest, they stood together once more at the Carteneau Flats, where they fought desperately to secure the area for the ritual to cast the red moon back unto the heavens. To the shock of all present, however, Bahamut burst forth from Dalamud and proceeded to unleash his fury upon the realm. While it is held that Louisoix had defeated the dread being, all memories of the Calamity were shrouded in haze, and no one remembers what actually happened.
