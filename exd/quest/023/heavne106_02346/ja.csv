You find her outside the camp enjoying a moment of quiet solitude with Ga Bu, and after joining her, she tells you of her struggle to understand her grandfather's motivations and to find her own path having parted ways with her brother. The story of her journey seems more than a little familiar, as does the answer she found at the end of it: that in a world where high-minded ideals and earnest efforts all too often fall short, where the good suffer and the evil prosper, one must nevertheless aspire to a higher ideal. Her heart thus unburdened, Alisaie bids you share some tales of your time in the north, and you duly recount an adventure near and dear to your heart.

"","TEXT_HEAVNE106_02346_SEQ_05<tab>Back at the Waking Sands, Urianger shares his latest findings. Per Alisaie's request, he has studied <var 1A 02 /var>The Gerun Oracles<var 1A 01 /var> and discovered a passage which suggests that a Rejoining would result in the deaths of all those living upon a reflection of the Source. Yet in death there is seemingly life as their souls would then be returned to the Source, where they might be reborn anew. Drastic as it sounds, Urianger speculates this may yet be preferable to the alternative, for it is possible that a world which falls to transcendent Light or Dark may ultimately be transformed into an unfathomable void.

Even as you pause to contemplate the implications of these theories, Urianger reveals that the Ishgardian smugglers supplying the beast tribes with crystals have been identified as remnants of the criminal network established by Eline Roaille─the infamous Garlean spymaster, the Ivy. What is more, the group has recently supplied crystals to another party: refugees devoted to the cause of Ala Mhigan liberation. Wasting no time, Alphinaud bids you and Alisaie accompany him to Little Ala Mhigo to track down the shipment's recipients and find out what they intend.

As you round the corner and head for the exit, you and the twins are contacted via linkpearl by Thancred, who proudly informs you of the latest developments in Ishgard. When he subsequently hears that you have obtained the same information, however, his disappointment is palpable. A troubled Alisaie then confirms that the raid on the smugglers' hideout was conducted less than an hour before, and that only a select few should know the group's true identity, and the destination of their final shipment...","TEXT_HEAVNE106_02346_SEQ_05<tab>砂の家に入り、ウリエンジェと話した。世界の統合についての話と、召喚用クリスタルの取引についての情報を得た。砂の家の「アルフィノ」と話そう。","","False","0x00000005","",""
