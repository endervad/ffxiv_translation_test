前回までの冒険録：
タレソンから話を聞いていると、オル・ディーがグリンブルスティが怒っていると知らせにやってきた。話を聞くと、グリンブルスティは広場を正しく修復できないと思い、怒っていたという。かの竜に修復可能だと証明するため、モグモグ修復団は広場中央の泉水の修復にとりかかる。問題となるのは、ただひとつ水源の確保。これを、ウェイ・アフの咆哮で、力の弱い湧水のクリスタルを活性化させることで解決する。水源を確保し、修復可能だと示すモグジンを、グリンブルスティは認めるものの、ひとつだけ条件をつける。それは、泉水に備えられていた「友情の証」の石像を修復すること。モグジンはこの条件を挑戦だと受け止め、修復にますます燃えるのだった。
