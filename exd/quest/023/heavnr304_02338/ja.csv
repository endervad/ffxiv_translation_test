"","TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_SEQ_01<tab>Biggs briefs you on the task at hand. In order to disable the core and end the primal threat, you will first need to cut off its supply of aether─this much you gleaned from your last trip into the heart of the colossus. While the precise means by which this may be done is mere speculation at this point, Cid has determined that your best chance is to return to Central Control. Complicating matters is the fact that the only way in is through the main generators─the chamber that Quickthinx portentously warned would be the site of your demise. Though it is clear that he possesses no special insight into the future, it would stand to reason that the master of the Illuminati is prepared to meet you with the full force of his mechanical army. Ready yourself for battle, then venture back into the belly of the beast!

クイックシンクスが未来を予見できたのは、過去の世界で記録屋バックリクスが紛失した、「データレコード」のおかげだった。しかし、クイックシンクスは、ラウンドロクスを介することなく「エニグマ・コーデックス」を操作し、最強の審判者を召喚してみせる。彼もまた、コーデックスに選ばれた、稀有な資質の持ち主であった……。

最後の作戦が始まった。冒険者はコアを停止に追い込むため、アレキサンダーの「中枢大動力室」へと向かうのだった。

Seemingly from nowhere, a smaller─though still passably enormous─embodiment of the colossus appears before you, summoning forth a massive energy field, and for an instant, time stops. The field soon dissipates, however, prompting an obviously perturbed Quickthinx to order Alexander to simply annihilate you. The colossus-within-a-colossus duly endeavors to oblige, firing a massive beam of destructive light that you are only barely able to evade, before disappearing into what appears to be a self-contained pocket of time. With even Cid unable to provide any real insight into what has just occurred, you have no recourse but to enter the time distortion and eliminate the mechanical menace.
