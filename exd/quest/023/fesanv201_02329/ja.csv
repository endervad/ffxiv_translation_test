The group plans to mark the anniversary of the realm's rebirth by putting on a play depicting the Calamity, but the actor assigned the part of the Warrior of Light would like more information to fully bring his role to life. On top of that, the script the troupe has been given is proving less than helpful in determining how best to act. Desiring to host the most entertaining show possible, the troupe asks you to bring their would-be hero to the Quicksand, that he might hear Momodi's version of events and use her story to inform his performance.
