"","TEXT_CHRHDB652_02372_SEQ_08<tab>Full of vim and vigor, Inspector Hildibrand leads you and the others to Zenith, where he confronts the Grand Sers once more. The rejuvenated warriors look on you in disdain, proclaiming that they have a dragon to slay. When it becomes apparent that Hildibrand will not go quietly, they execute a spectacular and strangely familiar attack...but when the dust at last settles, Hildibrand remains standing. The young father implores his wayward and pointy-eyed son to give up his futile quest before it claims his life. Alas, in a fit of rage, the mammet once more reasserts his ability to return anyone and everyone to their ideal form, and brings his magicks to bear on Hildibrand himself...but to no avail.

Gigi knows not what to make of his failure, leading the inspector and Cyr to explain that the true nature of his powers is not to turn back the hands of time, but to make manifest his ideals─to remake the world and everything in it as the mammet sees fit. Once Archmagus Quan understood that Gigi already saw him as perfect, he realized the only way to achieve his goal of immortality would be to erase the memories of the mammet he had come to view as his last remaining family. Unable to do so, he came to terms with his inevitable death. However, before he passed, Archmagus Quan decided that the only way to protect Gigi from those who would seek his powers was to take his memories after all, and leave him free to begin a new life─a new story all his own.

Unsurprisingly, Dorys and her comrades have no intention of surrendering the mammet, and make one final attempt to kill you and the others by sending several tonzes of ancient masonry crashing down upon your heads. But in that instant, Gigi rises into the air and uses the last of his remaining aether to return all to the way it should be: Zenith restored, you and your comrades safe, the Grand Sers their natural age, and Hildibrand unconscious.

As all struggle to come to terms with this new yet familiar state of affairs, Hildibrand rises and resolves to resume his adventures, and is duly delivered into the air by his dear mother after choosing his words poorly. Cyr is relieved to discover that Gigi is not forever lost, but may one day reawaken once he has regained sufficient aether. However, the former inquisitor is also acutely aware that the life he once led is forever lost. Fortunately, the inspector left behind a smashing gazebo that Julyan is more than willing to let him look after until her son comes back down.","TEXT_CHRHDB652_02372_SEQ_08<tab>十分油を塗りこまれたヒルディブランドと、白亜の宮殿に乗り込んだ。若返った壮年騎士団の目的は、聖竜を倒してその眼を奪って力を得ることだった。ギギは、ヒルディブランドの必死の説得と、大魔導士クワンに捨てられたわけではないと知り、考えを改める。しかし、ドリスは宮殿の柱を爆破し、ヒルディブランドたちを下敷きにしようとする。ギギは、最後の力で柱を元通りにして皆を救う。壮年騎士団たちは老人に戻ってしまい、観念するのだった。そして、ギギは力尽きて動かなくなってしまう。ヒルディブランドは、ギギがどこかへ旅立ったと知らされ、ジュリアンによって空高く飛ばされてしまった。彼の献身的な父親ぶりと、ギギの時魔法によって、一連の事件は幕を閉じたようだ。白亜の宮殿の「キール」と話そう。","","False","0x00000008","",""

For all his recent troubles, Cyr appears to be a man at peace. No longer bound to serve a cause he did not believe, he is free to begin anew as a consulting inspector, much like the man whose gazebo he has taken as his own. Though your time together is at an end, he hopes that your paths will cross again someday, and he prays that the Fury will bless and keep you in your travels.
