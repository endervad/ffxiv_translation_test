The moment is short-lived, however, as a sudden linkpearl transmission from Cid reveals that Roundrox has gone missing from the Shortstop.

"","TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_SEQ_02<tab>You find Roundrox standing at a lookout point in the Collectors' Quarter, where─as the goblin child explains it─she came to do some thinking. She then shows you a stone fragment that somehow fell into her possessions as she was fleeing the colossus. It is one of her precious glowstones─a shattered fragment of the <var 1A 02 /var>Enigma Codex<var 1A 01 /var>─and yet, she explains wistfully, it glows for her no more. Cid and Y'shtola arrive, and upon hearing the story, the former posits that Roundrox's experiences inside the colossus have fundamentally changed the girl─she is no longer a naive child, but one who has seen both the wonders and horrors that technology can give rise to in the single-minded pursuit of an ideal of perfection. Roundrox, her eyes firmly fixed on the future, expresses her desire to deliver the codex shard back to Mide and Dayan, a sweet gesture which Y'shtola laments as impossible, as the barrier surrounding the colossus is now all but impenetrable. With uncanny timing, the coeurl kitten Shanoa returns to the scene, mewing as if she were offering to carry out Roundrox's wish. Thinking that it wouldn't be the strangest thing to have happened in recent days, you look on as Roundrox entrusts the codex shard to Shanoa, who happily bounds away. The threat of the primal now passed, Cid and Y'shtola take their leave, the latter entrusting you with a weathered tome to be delivered to Backrix. And so you set off back to the Shortstop.","TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_SEQ_02<tab>Du findest die bedrückte Rundblox, wie sie auf Alexander hinunterstarrt.

Als Rundblox sagt, dass sie das Fragment Mide zurückgeben möchte, taucht die schwarze Katze auf. Aus ihrem Miauen schließt ihr, dass sie den Kodex für euch in die abgeschlossene Zeitblase von Mide bringen will ... Ob sie das kann? Jedenfalls scheint nun alles überstanden zu sein.

"","TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_SEQ_03<tab>Backrix's eyes light up at the sight of the tome, which he explains is a Sharlayan book of legends he had requested of Y'shtola. He reads from a chapter containing the legends of the Hotgo, a tribe of blue-haired Au Ra. According to their myth of creation, the Hotgo trace their ancestry back to two children─a boy and a girl─who emerged from the belly of a great steel giant in days of yore. All present are astounded when Backrix further reveals that, according to the legend, the two children were named Dayan and Mide, and that they are said to have emerged from the giant holding a curious black stone that glowed at the touch of a hand. Though you can only speculate as to the wrinkles and twists of time that have brought such implausible events to pass, you can once again look to the future knowing that the primal threat has been subdued, and history set back on its proper course.","TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_SEQ_03<tab>Rückblix liest das Sharlayaner Buch voller Interesse.
