At last understanding her intent, the two of you turn your restorative magicks upon the tonberry. Rejuvenated, it rises to its feet, and reveals that it was once a man named Surito Carito, one of countless Nymians transformed by a mysterious sickness, and imprisoned within the Wanderer's Palace by their own countrymen. Like his fellow Nymians, Surito was driven mad by his fate─until you returned with his dear companion Lily and cleansed him of his rancor.

Declaring that only you are fit to wield the magicks now, he bequeaths to you a scholar's gown, as well as knowledge of the spell Sacred Soil.
