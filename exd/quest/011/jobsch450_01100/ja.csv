"","TEXT_JOBSCH450_01100_SEQ_01<tab>Alka Zolka has come into possession of ancient engravings which purport to show the traditional raiments of Nymian scholars. Coupled with information gleaned from other sources, he believes he has deduced the raiments' design. However, he wishes to conclusively verify their historical accuracy by recreating the garments and gauging your faerie's reaction. In order to do so, he will need to enlist the aid of a preeminent Eorzean weaver─namely, Master Redolent Rose of Sunsilk Tapestries. Approaching him now would be premature, though, as you must first gather the leaves of a direwort.
