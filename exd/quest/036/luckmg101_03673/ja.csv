冒険者は、水晶公の導きにより、光に包まれた「第一世界」に降り立つ。「暁」の賢人とともに世界を襲う脅威「罪喰い」を撃退し、第一世界に闇を取り戻していく冒険者だが、その過程で、肉体に光を溜め込み、罪喰いと同様の存在になってしまう。それを予期していた水晶公は、冒険者の「光」を自身で引き受けようとするが、その行動は、冒険者を注視していたアシエン・エメトセルクに阻まれる。水晶公をさらっていったアシエン・エメトセルクを追って、冒険者たちは、彼が作り出した、終末を迎えんとする幻影都市アーモロートにたどり着く。その最奥部で、アシエン・エメトセルクを倒した冒険者は、「闇の戦士」として、第一世界に完全に闇を取り戻すことを成し遂げたのだった。
