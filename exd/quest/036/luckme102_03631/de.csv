"","TEXT_LUCKME102_03631_SEQ_01<tab>By all indications, the residents of Gatetown are under Vauthry's mind control, and as Urianger attempts to fathom its workings, Alisaie arrives with your old friend Kai-Shirr in tow. Based on his account of events, it would seem that those who have lived in Gatetown the longest were the first to be affected. All the pieces fall into place when Y'shtola subsequently returns brandishing a loaf of meol. With dread and disbelief, Ryne immediately recognizes the Eulmoran staple for what it is: sin eater flesh, the consumption of which apparently renders one susceptible to Vauthry's influence. This sickening revelation leaves everyone aghast, but the horrors do not end there... Recalling the words you heard during your first visit to Eulmore, Alphinaud shares his suspicion that citizens who have outlived their usefulness are being deliberately turned into sin eaters. Suppressing the urge to gag, you endeavor to put such thoughts from your mind, and concentrate instead on the task at hand: hunting down the Lightwarden. The being is all but certain to be hiding in Eulmore's upper levels, and it is decided that you will lead the charge into the city.","TEXT_LUCKME102_03631_SEQ_01<tab>Alles deutet darauf hin, dass die Bewohner von Torstadt unter Vauthrys Kontrolle stehen.

Wer davon isst, wird anfällig für Vauthrys Verzauberung. Doch damit nicht genug: Alphinaud erfasst, dass die Arbeiter Eulmores, die nicht mehr gebraucht werden, in Sünden<var 16 /var>ver<var 16 /var>tilger verwandelt und verspeist werden. Angewidert wendet ihr euch wieder eurer Aufgabe zu, den Licht<var 16 /var>bringer, der sich mit großer Wahr<var 16 /var>schein<var 16 /var>lich<var 16 /var>keit in Eulmore aufhält, zu finden.

Rejoined by your comrades, you then ascend to the Emergent and find Vauthry having dinner in his chamber. There, Ryne finally realizes that <var 1A 02 /var>he<var 1A 01 /var> is the Lightwarden, being an unholy mixture of man and sin eater. Before you are able to act, however, Vauthry sprouts wings and takes to the skies. Rushing to the balcony, you are met with an impossible sight: the peak of Mt. Gulg, torn from the earth and floating in the heavens. It is there that Vauthry appears to have fled.
