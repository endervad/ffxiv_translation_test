"","TEXT_FESANV501_03660_SEQ_05<tab>Arriving in Ul'dah, you and Bran quickly locate the minstrel, who genially acquiesces to your request for an interview─provided it is conducted on his terms─and proceeds to enlighten you as to the nature of the letter. As he tells it, it actually dates back to before the Calamity, when the minstrel and his adventurer friends were endeavoring to spread the word about the impending destruction far and wide across the land. As for why it has found its way to you years later, however, he cannot say. Moved to song, he begins to play an ode on his harp, but the song has only begun when you are whisked away to a curious pocket of time and space. There, you are greeted by a man bearing an uncanny resemblance to the minstrel, who introduces himself by the unusual name of “Naoki Yoshida.” He thanks you for the countless heroic deeds you have performed in Eorzea, and shares with you his own feelings of deep fondness for the realm you call home. Leaving you with a cryptic message suggesting that his unseen companions also wish to share words of gratitude with you by other means, he bids you farewell. In the next moment, you find yourself regaining your senses beside Bran and the minstrel, who has just finished what─judging from Bran's reaction─appears to have been a truly memorable performance. After the reporter rushes from the scene to begin penning his latest and greatest story, you share a reflective moment with the minstrel as you watch a spectacular fireworks display in the heavens above the sultanate. Your work done for today, you set out for Bloodshore to share news of all that has happened with P'obyano.","TEXT_FESANV501_03660_SEQ_05<tab>異邦の詩人と話し、詩を聴いて花火を見上げた。ブラッドショアにいる「紅蓮祭実行委員ペ・オビヤノ」に報告しよう。","","False","0x00000005","",""
