Indeed, he reasons, if all the combined energies bound to the weapon could be made into materia, the very souls you have worked so hard to cultivate can ascend to the new host. But whether such an outrageous thing is even possible remains to be seen. To find out, Gerolt bids you seek the counsel of Master Mutamix at the Bonfire.</target>
