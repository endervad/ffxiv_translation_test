The three of you set off for the palace to present the finished products to the palace seer, who awaits you in the courtyard of Vollok Shoonsa. While impressed by the design, the seer is most keen to ascertain the functionality of the reflectors, and puts them to the test immediately. Fortunately, the trial proves successful, with the seer not only extolling your exemplary work, but even offering XRral Soj Metalwares an official royal warrant of appointment. Rral Soj does not hesitate to accept, declaring it an honor. It seems that her lifelong dream of crafting metalwares fit for the royal family has been realized.</target>
