However, the means to analyze the aetherial properties of these memories yet eludes him. Enter Regana, accompanied by an Allagan node commissioned from Garlond Ironworks designed to do precisely that. Though daunted by the potential ramifications of accepting further help─financial or otherwise─Zlatan can see no other way to proceed with Gerolt's plan. As Regana explains, the node will use gathered memories to create a registry with which you can modify the Resistance weapon as you see fit. Hoping for an adequate sample size, Gerolt suggests searching for two types of memories, eighteen of each.
