不滅隊より、南ザナラーンで激化しつつあるアマルジャ族の人拐いについての調査を依頼された冒険者。現場へと赴くと、早速、アマルジャ族が商人を襲撃する場面に遭遇する。しかし、そこに現れた新たなアマルジャ族。その一党は、同胞であるはずのアマルジャ族を鎧袖一触する。彼らは「灰の一党」と呼ばれる孤高の戦闘集団で、ザンラクを拠点とするアマルジャ族とは対立しているらしい。その長「ハムジ・ガー」に戦士としての素質を見出された冒険者は、彼らのアジトである「灰の陣営」に招待される。そこで出会った灰の一党の戦士、ミコッテ族の少女「ルーン・ガー」とともに、ザンラクの人拐い部隊「炎牙衆」の野望を潰した冒険者。その活躍により、ハムジ・ガーは改めて冒険者を灰の一党の盟友として歓待するのだった。
