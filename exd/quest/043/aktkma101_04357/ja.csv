ついに結成された「グランドカンパニー・エオルゼア」。彼らと「暁の血盟」は、カルテノー平原へと進軍してきたテロフォロイの軍勢を撃退する。しかし、「終末の塔」の建造目的や、捕らえられた異種族の者たちを救う方法は謎のまま。同盟軍は知の都シャーレアンへと協力を要請するが、使者フルシュノが携えてきた返答は、完全なる拒絶だった。頑なに不干渉の姿勢を崩さず、説得にかかった我が子すら勘当したフルシュノの態度に違和感を覚えた「暁」は、クルルからの提案を受けてシャーレアン本国へ向かうことを決める。そして、クルルからの連絡を待つ間、「終末の塔」のもたらす変化を調査していた冒険者は、世界の危機を警告する謎の女性に出会うのだった。
