"","TEXT_AKTKMA110_04366_SEQ_03<tab>You find Krile by a patch of unusual flowers, and the reason behind her odd behavior finally becomes clear. It seems the headaches were a result of Hydaelyn attempting to make contact with one of Her chosen. Krile hands you a heartbloom, then relinquishes control of her body to the primal that She might deliver to you a message: “In darkness seek joy. Surrender not to sadness, and see beyond despair. Walk free, and bear the light for others to follow.”

Still contemplating Hydaelyn's cryptic words, you hear voices raised in protest further down the hill. Fourchenault, it seems, has caught wind of your investigations, and you are taken to the Rostra to stand trial at the Forum's inquiry. Though your colleagues seize the opportunity to confront Sharlayan's leadership with what they have recently learned, they succeed only in confirming that Fourchenault and the others are bound to a duty they cannot ignore─and that said duty is connected to a discovery made in the course of studies of the aetherial sea. The assembly concludes with a vote on a proposal allowing the Scions to remain in Sharlayan on the condition that you cease all efforts to discover the nature of the nation's “momentous duty.” The proposal is passed, and so you will not be expelled from the city...for now.","","","False","0x00000003","",""
