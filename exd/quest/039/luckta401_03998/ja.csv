"","TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_01<tab>Konogg, still inconsolable following the disappearance of his sister Anogg, explains that little has changed in Komra since last you spoke. This indeed seems to be the case, as several of the same villagers who previously spoke out against the twins soon arrive to further express their disgruntlement. Among them is a man you have not seen before, who hastens to chastise Konogg for his culpability in the tragedy that led to his wife's severe injury. Your dwarven friend is visibly shaken, and dissolves into tears on the spot.","TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_01<tab>前回までの冒険録：
活動停止していた２Ｐの再起動に成功したアノッグとコノッグ。２Ｐが「鍵」と呼ばれる装置を操作すると、突如、機械遺跡の坑道を激しい揺れが襲った。坑道の外へと飛び出した冒険者と双子のドワーフ族は、コメラの村がアンドロイドたちの攻撃を受けている光景を目撃する。２Ｐを止めるため、彼女とそっくりな姿をしたアンドロイド「２Ｂ」とともに、ドヴェルガル山脈に突如出現した巨大な建造物へ進入する一行。最奥で待ち受けていた２Ｐを退けることに成功するも、アノッグは意図せず２Ｐの策謀に手を貸してしまっていた事実を知り、ひどく落胆する。さらにその噂を聞きつけたコメラの村人たちが、双子の姉弟を弾劾せんと、坑道まで押しかけてきた。２Ｂの介入により村人たちは退散したが、機能停止している少年型のアンドロイド「９Ｓ」を抱き上げると、２Ｂは立ち去って行った。これで一連の騒動は沈静化したかに思えたが、今度は双子の姉、アノッグが姿をくらました。残された弟コノッグは、呆然と立ち尽くすことしかできないのであった……。
