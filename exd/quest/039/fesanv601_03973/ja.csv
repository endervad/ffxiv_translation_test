On this occasion, a work of fine art in stained glass serves as the focal point, and its creator, J'bhen Tia is on hand to explain his inspiration. He has chosen to depict one of the pivotal moments in Ul'dahn history prior to the Calamity in which Nanamo Ul Namo addressed the rioting masses, imploring them to put aside their grievances and instead cooperate for the greater good. To accompany the artwork, a wandering minstrel of great renown is due to give a recital to commemorate the event, and J'bhen Tia would like you to help distribute flyers to drum up as large a crowd as possible.
