To that end, he seeks to visit the three nations in hopes of enticing prominent merchants and traders to enter into a mutually profitable business partnership. No sooner has he asked for your escort than you are joined by none other than Count Charlemend de Durendaire, who imperiously insists that he join you on your expedition. Apprehensive but cautiously optimistic as to what lies ahead, you set off for the Carline Canopy in Gridania to join Francel and the count.","TEXT_LUCKHA201_03955_SEQ_01<tab>前回までの冒険録：
