Amidst the hubbub, you find Lord Artoirel, who thanks you for looking after his younger brother in the grand melee.

"","TEXT_HEAVNC110_02240_SEQ_04<tab>For one thousand years have generations of Ishgardians and Dravanians lived and died, unable to conceive of a world without war. But when, during the unveiling of a relief celebrating the union of Saint Shiva and Hraesvelgr, Ser Aymeric and Vidofnir come together and speak of peace, such a world seems more than mere fantasy.

The dream endures for all of an instant. Without warning, Estinien leaps down from on high and drives his lance into Vidofnir's back, the white dragon's blood painting the relief a deep red. As the dragon collapses, Ser Aymeric seizes a bow and looses an arrow at his friend's heart, duty guiding his hand. The dragoon has naught to fear from worldly weapons, however, swatting aside the deadly shaft and regaining his perch atop a nearby tower. Silence.

All present strain to see the man who once embodied Ishgard's defiance. Estinien's now-crimson armor radiates a malevolent power which pours forth from two massive, twitching eyes fused to his arm and shoulder. And when he speaks, it is not with the voice of a man, but a wyrm. Nidhogg. The wrathful shade declares that the final chorus of the Dragonsong War is nigh, and that all will soon answer for their sins. He then throws his arms wide, and with a bestial roar, transforms into his draconic form, taking wing for distant skies. Ser Aymeric's face is a mask, unreadable, his eyes fixed upon the wyrm as he whispers an oath you cannot hear for the cries of the crowd howling for Nidhogg's blood.

Alphinaud watches as the last guests leave Falcon's Nest. Vidofnir will live, he tells you, though it was surely not by accident. Nidhogg's declaration of war was doubtless also a demonstration of power for Hraesvelgr's brood─and for the Ishgardians, who could do naught but watch as he wielded Estinien as an instrument of his vengeance.","TEXT_HEAVNC110_02240_SEQ_04<tab>Vidofnir fliegt herbei und die Feier kann beginnen. Vor dem Friedensrelief und unter den gespannten Blicken des Publikums verkünden Aymeric und Vidofnir den neuen Frieden. Doch in diesem Moment wird Vidofnir von einer Lanze getroffen - Estinien ist gekommen, um den Ishgardern und den friedensbereiten Drachen den Krieg zu erklären. Er verwandelt sich in Nidhogg und fliegt weg. Was wird aus den Friedensplänen nun werden? Und was aus Estinien?","","False","0x00000004","",""
