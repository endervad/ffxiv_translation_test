"","TEXT_HEAVNC108_02238_SEQ_02<tab>Change, however well intentioned, is often met with resistance. With resignation and pride both, Ser Aymeric admits that Ishgard is a nation built on centuries of warfare. To pursue peace in denial of this history is a doomed venture; rather, the people must be encouraged to embrace their identity, and take pride in one another's achievements, that they might be moved to common purpose. Happily, they will not want for suitable encouragement. The other members of the Eorzean Alliance have recently proposed joint military exercises, which Ser Aymeric believes could be presented as a “grand melee” to the public. Should Ishgard's forces triumph over those of the other city<var 1F /var>states, it would doubtless do much to restore the nation's morale. Lord Edmont acknowledges that there is merit to the lord commander's plan, and his only request is that his younger son take part in the melee, that he might make amends for his mistakes in Falcon's Nest.
