As luck would have it, townsfolk have been spinning tales of a strange Far Eastern traveler who seeks danger at every opportunity. She claims Petyr Winsome stole her thunder with his piece on an otherworldly traveler, and has jumped at this opportunity to write an amazing story of her own. The only problem is her subject's fixation with dangerous places. It is for this reason Remumu asks for your company in her investigation. According to the latest gossip, the traveler was last seen near Costa del Sol, and that is where she wishes to begin.

She seems to be lost, and asks of places nowhere to be found in Eorzea. Remumu suspects the situation is more complicated than expected, and soon discovers the traveler has lost her memory. She introduces herself as Iroha, and says the only thing she clearly remembers is training to perfect a technique she calls Amatsu: Kyori. Remumu supposes that, by continuing her training, she may recall other things related to her drills, and ultimately the purpose of learning this technique. To secure Iroha's success, and hopefully her latest article, Remumu asks you to help.
