Their report concluded, you share your own assessment─that while order was restored, the people's faith in Ser Aymeric and his initiative has been gravely shaken. Head bowed, Lucia solemnly acknowledges that she has no choice but to call a halt to proceedings. Lord Artoirel duly orders his brother to return to Ishgard and answer for his actions, and he sullenly acquiesces, calling for his manservant to accompany him.

After offering some words of comfort, the child's eyes close once more, prompting his master to loudly bemoan the circumstances of his failure. His continued refusal to accept responsibility grates your ears, and you step forward to speak─only to be stopped by Thancred, who proceeds to scold Emmanellain himself. Overcome with rage at the unflappable Archon's lecturing, the lordling unwisely lashes out, declaring that the man has never felt the sting of failure. Thancred, in turn, deals Lord Emmanellain a swingeing blow, snarling that he knows nothing of him and his failures.
