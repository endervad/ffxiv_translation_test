"","TEXT_HEAVNC106_02236_SEQ_01<tab>Per Lord Emmanellain's suggestion, you decide to partake of the food and drink in the nearby tavern. Desiring privacy, you opt for a secluded seat in the corner, and drink deep from a mug of mulled wine provided by a young waitress. You find yourself listening half-heartedly as she speaks of this and that...your eyes growing heavy, your limbs sapped of all strength. She turns, and through the haze you see her eyes, burning with contempt. You crumple to the ground, and as all fades to black, you hear her whisper to sleep, to sleep...

A grave, and a woman. No─two women, and a man. Countless graves, countless lives lost. A war that would never end, no─not for them. They came together, unwilling and unable to forgive, to forget. They learned of the conference and despaired...until she stepped forward. For she had a plan.

Thancred rouses you from your slumber, and from beyond the tavern doors you can hear the faint sounds of fighting. Bursting forth, you find chaos. Soldiers and civilians─some whom you recognize from your vision─lie dead and dying. From atop a wall she calls out. The woman from the tavern─from your vision. She cries out for vengeance against the Dravanians, and Emmanellain, in a panic, commands a nearby knight to act. As the crowd looks on, the knight shoots, striking her in the arm. Wounded and enraged, she decries the lordling and all for which he stands, before a second arrow silences her, and she falls from sight. All eyes turn to the young lord as he pleads his innocence, that all was a misunderstanding. But you know full well that it is too late for excuses.","TEXT_HEAVNC106_02236_SEQ_01<tab>Per Lord Emmanellain's suggestion, you decide to partake of the food and drink in the nearby tavern.
