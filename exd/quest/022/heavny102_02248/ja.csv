In a bid to discourage treasure hunters and put the island's remoteness to use, he petitioned Admiral Merlwyb to reserve Hullbreaker for the training of Maelstrom recruits.

After a bemusing interlude involving the ladies of the Sanguine Sirens and the carnivorous pet of the Kraken's Arms, the drill appears to be brought back on course as you spar with the Maelstrom's elite forces. Having defeated the Grand Company's finest, you find yourself in the presence of the Admiral, who came to witness the duel with your final opponent─Eynzahr Slafyrsyn himself.

No sooner have the words left his lips than he notices Eynzahr's bruises, and realizes that he too participated. Visibly embarrassed, the storm marshal stiffly thanks you for taking part in the drill and excuses himself, leaving Denston to lament his commanding officer's advancing years.
