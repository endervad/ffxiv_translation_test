Not to be outdone, however, Krile and Thancred appear shortly thereafter, to share with the others the next step in their plan for tracking down Minfilia. Theorizing that Hydaelyn's direct intercession must leave a measurable impact on the ambient aether, they intend to study the battlefield where you faced the Ultima Weapon─where She shielded you with the blessing of Light: the Praetorium. Though he knows not how such data may be put to use, Alphinaud nevertheless defers to your comrades' judgment, as well as their suggestion that you, Alphinaud, and Tataru see to the necessary preparations for the long-lost Scions' homecoming.","TEXT_HEAVNC101_02231_SEQ_01<tab>前回までの冒険録：
教皇代行であるアイメリクは、聖竜の眷属「ヴィゾーヴニル」を皇都に招き、人と竜との交流の再開を宣言しようとしていた。一方、「暁」の行方不明者を探すため、シャーレアンから「クルル」が到着。クルルとともに賢人「サンクレッド」の行方を追う中で、冒険者は、蛮神「ラーヴァナ」を討伐する「闇の戦士」と出会うのだった。どうにかサンクレッドと合流を果たしてイシュガルドに帰還した一行。皇都は、アイメリク襲撃事件や放火事件によって、不穏な空気に包まれていた。力を合わせて放火の実行犯を捕まえたものの、焼け出された市民が集う教皇庁を占拠されたとの報告が。一連の事件は、イシュガルドの変革を望まない「守旧派」によるものだった。守旧派の凶行により、あわや大惨事となりかけたところに、ヴィゾーヴニルの助けが入る。そうしてにわかに近づいた、竜と人の距離……このまま、アイメリクの目指す「真の変革」に辿りつくことができるのだろうか？
