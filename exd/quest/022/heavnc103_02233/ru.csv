To that end, he has begun making formal arrangements for a peace conference in Falcon's Nest, to be attended by Vidofnir...and by you, if possible. He admits that your presence would be more than a symbolic gesture, as he fears that Nidhogg and his followers may attempt to disrupt the proceedings. Moved by his passion, you agree, and prepare to leave for Falcon's Nest and speak with Lucia. In that moment, however, Ser Aymeric calls out, asking that you share a drink once the conference has concluded─doubtless a gesture of gratitude and camaraderie.
