Rather than engage the creature, however, you elect to flee the violently heaving vessel at the behest of what appears to be a talking cat. Once outside in your manacutter, you are witness to an incredible spectacle: the prow of the ship splits open, and emits a blinding blast of light that tears a rent in the very sky. The belly of the vessel then ejects the huge coffin, which disappears into the gaping rift...

"","TEXT_HEAVNM102_02205_SEQ_04<tab>Back on solid ground, your rendezvous with Utata does not proceed as planned: Radlia and her axe-wielding brutes have taken the Redbill engineer captive. They ransom her for the ectocompass, but not before Leofard slips a linkpearl into the device's casing. Though concerned about Radlia's plans for the Ark, the Redbill captain first wishes to learn more of the cat creature─one “Cait Sith”─and of the haunted vessel upon which he dwelt.

You return to the Redbills' den, and the loquacious feline reveals his nature as a familiar. He tells the tale of High Voidmage Cessair, and of the Mhachi magi who constructed the Void Ark as a means to escape the great floods of the Sixth Umbral Calamity. Sadly for them, he continues, they proved unable to control the potent entity chosen to power the ship─whom he calls Scathach, the Shadow Queen─and were forced to contend with the horde of lesser voidsent servants that her rampant energies set loose. Though they ultimately succeeded in rebinding the creatures, they did so at the cost of their own lives, leaving Cait Sith alone to guard a derelict prison. For fifteen hundred years the Void Ark drifted, until a determined voidsent arrived on the ship and once more released its malevolent inmates, his efforts culminating in what you now understand to be the liberation of Scathach's warded tomb.

After hearing Cait Sith's story, Leofard vows to aid him in tracking down the Queen's Coffin...and collect any ancient treasures uncovered along the way. For the time being, however, the pirate captain encourages you to return to your adventures, adding that you should always keep an ear open for the Redbills' call to arms.","TEXT_HEAVNM102_02205_SEQ_04<tab>「レッドビル」の前に、突如現れた「大鷲連合」に、「霊風の羅針盤」を奪われてしまった。彼女たちの企みも気にかかるが、レオファードはまずケット・シーから話を聞く。ケット・シーは、古代の都市「マハ」時代の魔道士クェーサルの使い魔だと正体を明かす。第六霊災を生き延びるために出航した浮遊船「魔航船」は、動力に使っていた妖異スカアハの暴走により、死の船となって1500年の間雲海を彷徨っていたという。ディアボロスが落とした棺に眠るスカアハを探しだすため、ケット・シーに協力することを決めるレオファード。「レッドビル」が棺を捜索する間、冒険者はしばしの自由を手にするのだった。","","False","0x00000004","",""
