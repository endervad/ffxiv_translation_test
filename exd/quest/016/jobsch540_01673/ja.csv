"","TEXT_JOBSCH540_01673_SEQ_01<tab>The cause of Surito Carito's frustration is a lack of progress─he cannot cure the sickness without learning more of it. He explains the scourge of his people came from the ocean, upon a trader's galley. Sailors lost in a terrible storm drifted to a desert isle in the south seas, where they met a tribe of Lalafells. These natives gave the traders succor, and sent them home with a wondrous gift─an ornate amphora. Upon hearing the tale in full, however, Alka Zolka realizes that this vase may be the sickness's source, for would not these traders otherwise have transformed?

Bewildered, he wonders if everything, from the storm to the traders' miraculous return, had been a Mhachi plot to bring low his people. Greatly troubled, he asks for time to think upon the role that void magi played in spreading the sickness.
