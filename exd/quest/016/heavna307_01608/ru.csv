It is not long before Lady Iceheart herself arrives to investigate the signal. You explain your desire to parley with Nidhogg, but the heretics' mistress quickly dismisses the plan as futile. She relates the history of treachery that fuels the great wyrm's wrath, and Estinien, though disagreeing on the point of Nidhogg's present goal, concedes that the maddened beast is unlikely to listen to reason. Alphinaud then suggests that speaking with Hraesvelgr, another of the seven great wyrms, may provide a more promising chance at peace. Lady Iceheart insists upon accompanying your party, and offers to lead you to Hraesvelgr's lair. As you resolve to depart for the dragons' homeland, the light of your Crystal of Ice suddenly flares once more...","","","False","0x00000003","",""
