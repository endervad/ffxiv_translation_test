After rousing them, they deny that they would ever shirk their duty in such a way, but the facts suggest otherwise. Though Tentoawa is certain that the cradle is to blame, he is unwilling to openly remark upon it. With Leophyne nowhere to be found, the young warrior suggests returning to Ishgard to plan your next course of action.</target>

He transfers his fatigue to another known as the Shut Eye─Loazenikwe─and confesses that she has been asleep for most of her life. He confesses he never considered the cradle's impact on his life prior to its theft, and that he only now realizes its potential for misuse. Although you must wait for further news of Leophyne's movements, the young warrior remains as resolute as ever in his goal to capture her.
