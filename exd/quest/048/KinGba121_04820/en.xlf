You ponder the implications of this before Firmalbert arrives to inform you that more Temple Knights have been found asleep while on guard duty. Tentoawa finds this obsession with shaming the knights peculiar, and suggests that following them might be an effective way to track down Leophyne. As luck would have it, Firmalbert knows that a group of Temple Knights is even now joining knights from House Durendaire to patrol the ruins of Gorgagne Mills. You decide to assist them, and Firmalbert instructs you to speak with Redwald before departing for the mills.</target>
