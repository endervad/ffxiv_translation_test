Vanhudi remains unrepentant in the face of Hildibrand's scornful accusations, even going so far as to invite you to join his wildly ambitious scheme to conquer the entire world. Disappointed yet unsurprised by your refusal, he puts into motion a contingency plan prepared far in advance. It transpires that hidden caches of crystals and the faith of his cloned selves shall provide the aetherial fuel for a summoning ritual then and there, for anyone who stands against him is an obstacle to be removed─in your case, a task he entrusts to the sixfold blades of divine Asura.

        <target state="final">TEXT_CHRHDB852_04800_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;After witnessing the fall of his primal champion, Vanhudi attempts to flee, only to be foiled when his airship is shot down by a familiar-looking alien starship. This vessel belongs to PuPu's missing friend, who had been deceived by the avaricious merchant─and as a result determined that the people of Etheirys cannot be trusted. The alien thus declares his intention to subjugate the world, beginning with Hildibrand and company.

PuPu uses his own starship to fend off the rampaging extraterrestrial, and the counterattack unintentionally breaches his opponent's reactor core. Realizing that the craft is primed for a violent explosion, Brandihild manipulates the ship's external controls to fly it high into the air before it detonates in spectacular fashion. In light of Brandihild's heroics, PuPu's comrade has a change of heart, becoming convinced that peaceful coexistence on Etheirys is possible after all.

Hildibrand assures everyone that his hardy clone will be just fine, then turns his attention to PuPu's damaged starship...which promptly malfunctions, abducts the frantic inspector, then takes off into the distance at a ludicrous rate of speed. Unperturbed by this typical turn of events and content to leave Vanhudi to the mercy of the Radiant Host, Godbert suggests a return to Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han.</target>

Meanwhile, the aliens who provided said answers offer their own farewells as they set off to explore the wide world they now call home. Last but not least, Delion thanks you for helping him find the truth behind his outlandish conspiracies, before immediately rushing off in search of some new mystery to misinterpret. One only wonders what became of the inspectors after fate propelled them along their separate celestial trajectories...
