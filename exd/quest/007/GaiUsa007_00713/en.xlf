How would you fancy doing your bit to preserve the peace? We patrol the area night and day, but a recent skirmish put a dozen of my best men in the infirmary, and we're sorely shorthanded as a result.</target>

Now, there are three strategic positions on our patrol route, each marked by a Twin Adder standard. What you need to do is go to the three locations in turn and hold your ground for a while. Nothing to it, see?</target>

...A run-in with fell fiends, you say? That is passing odd. We have never had trouble with the local fauna on this patrol route in the past.</target>
