"","TEXT_STMBDA101_02446_SEQ_01<tab>Ilberd's assault on Baelsar's Wall and subsequent summoning of the primal now known as “Shinryu” left the Eorzean Alliance with little choice but to occupy Castrum Oriens─an act almost certain to be interpreted as the prelude to a full-scale invasion. Yet if the Alliance must go to war, it would not do so alone. General Raubahn Aldynn has asked that the Scions of the Seventh Dawn secure the support of the Ala Mhigan Resistance, that they might join forces with the Alliance and drive the legions of Garlemald from Eorzea once and for all. This formal request for aid was not unanticipated, and you and your fellow Scions take little time to reach a consensus. To Ala Mhigo you will go─with Lyse to lead the way, given her ties to the Resistance.","TEXT_STMBDA101_02446_SEQ_01<tab>前回までの冒険録：
イルベルドが召喚した「新たな神」を迎え撃つため、エオルゼア諸国の領袖たちは、古代アラグ帝国が用いた対蛮神兵器「オメガ」の起動を決意する。かつての敵であり、この計画の発案者でもあるネロを交え、シドと光の戦士たちは、一路、アウトロー戦区「カルテノー平原」へと向かう。そして、帝国軍部隊を蹴散らし、オメガを起動させることに成功するのだった。一方、光の繭に封じられていた蛮神は、これに呼応するかのように封印を破って顕現。バエサルの長城の上空にて、ドラゴン型の「新たな神」とオメガの壮絶な一騎打ちが始まる。周囲の環境にも影響を及ぼす激しい戦闘の末、両者は東に広がる帝国領ギラバニア方面へと消えていったのだった。
