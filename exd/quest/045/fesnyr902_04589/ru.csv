Before you can say a word, however, he asks for a moment of your time, nodding in Beaudefoin's direction. His desire to lift the adventurer's spirits is quickly apparent, and though he makes a valiant effort to do so, the despondent man can no longer see reason. Convinced that his words cannot reach the down-on-his-luck adventurer, the omikujishi instead turns to you, asking that you too make an attempt to cheer the poor man up.

And yet, upon reading it, Beaudefoin somehow manages to sink even further into the depths of despair. The omikujishi, having at last lost patience, reads the remainder of the fortune himself. The fortune's final words of guidance, and a well-placed remark from yourself are what finally release Beaudefoin from the clutches of his own fear. But no sooner has he been made to see reason than the mochi daikan appears before you out of breath, bringing distressing news of an adventurer in trouble. Believing this adventurer to be Hildelana, Beaudefoin rushes off to the rescue.

The omikujishi reminds the flabbergasted man, still unable to believe his luck, that omikuji should be seen as a guide, and not as one's fate set in stone. With a new set of armor in tow, Beaudefoin and Hildelana are ready to set off on a new adventure, their bond of friendship tempered by the day's events. Turning to you, the omikujishi thanks you for your service, offering you a set of yoroi of your own, and the opportunity to draw as many omikuji as you wish.
