To do so, he needs silk cocoons from the wamoura breeding ground south of Ok' Zundu. Harvest the cocoons and bring them back to Linu Vanu.</target>

He anticipates with bated breath that the cocoons might hold juicy wamoura grubs as a surprise snack, and suggests you try one next time...if you are daring.</target>
