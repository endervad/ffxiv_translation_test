"","TEXT_HEAVNY201_02114_SEQ_02<tab>Arriving in the solar of the Rising Stones, you are greeted by a masked boy, who introduces himself as Unukalhai. He proceeds to alert you to the rising threat of beings known as eikons, which he clarifies are not the primals you know so well. Rather, the term “eikon” and the beings to which it refers date back to the days of the Allagan Empire. At this juncture, Urianger makes an unannounced appearance and takes over the explanation. It appears that the Warring Triad, three eikons sealed within the Aetherochemical Research Facility on Azys Lla, are threatening to break free. To compound matters, the primals you had but recently defeated have also been resummoned. While Urianger considers measures, you must attend to the task of vanquishing the primals, lest they seek to seize the power of the slumbering eikons and hasten their awakening. Unukalhai will assist you in this endeavor, though his allegiance and motive yet remain a mystery.","TEXT_HEAVNY201_02114_SEQ_02<tab>Im Saal der Morgenröte wirst du von einem maskierten Jungen besucht, der sich als Unukalhai und Diener <var 1A 02 /var>eines guten Bekannten<var 1A 01 /var> von dir vorstellt.
