Alas, the man will not hear reason, being convinced beyond all doubt that Ser Aymeric is a traitor to both kin and country. In a final act of defiance, he throws Maelie from the ledge, sending the child tumbling towards the plaza.

Far below, Lucia and Y'shtola can only watch in horror as the screaming figure plummets towards them. But just when all hope seems lost, a great white dragon swoops down to pluck her from the very jaws of death. Vidofnir!

Soon after, you, Ser Aymeric, and Lord Artoirel join the others outside, where Vidofnir is waiting to deliver a warning from Hraesvelgr. It would seem Nidhogg and his brood have flown for skies unknown. When Alphinaud subsequently presses the dragon for answers regarding Estinien, she declares that she can provide none, and bids you farewell. Though her visit was all too brief, Ser Aymeric hopes that it will do much to change the opinions of the common man. Yet Lord Edmont, who does not share in his optimism, implores the young knight to move with greater caution, lest more perish in his headlong rush for change─not least Ser Aymeric himself, whom the count plainly cherishes as a son.","TEXT_HEAVNB108_02163_SEQ_03<tab>Ihr verfolgt die Geiselnehmer und stellt deren Anführer, einen papsttreuen Priester.
