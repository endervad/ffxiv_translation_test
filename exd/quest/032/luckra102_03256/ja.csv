"","TEXT_LUCKRA102_03256_SEQ_01<tab>After returning to camp, Thancred is filled with apprehension upon hearing that Ryne intends to restore the world's natural balance by seizing control of Eden. She has detected something resembling the core of a Talos and suggests using similar methods to manipulate it. Urianger agrees that her theory is sound, and he posits that by riding aetherial currents, you will be able to teleport to the inner reaches. However, Thancred points out that although Eden seems to be in a mostly dormant state, there is likely to be some manner of defense against intruders, possibly utilizing powerful sin eaters. Since you are the only one able to vanquish a Lightwarden without it transferring to a new host, Thancred requests that you lead the way. Despite not having the slightest inkling as to what lies in wait, you and your fellow adventurers nevertheless step forward, ready to face any foe that would bar your way.
