Giott theorizes, based upon your recent vision, that the Virtue reflexively heals those sin eaters it recognizes as helmless dwarves─those of Lamitt's people who joined her in exile─and concludes that adding a helm to any eaters you would prefer remain dead may be enough to deter it from doing so. Though this seems almost too easy, it is true that sin eaters are simple beings, with no real powers of cognition that might allow them to see through even rudimentary deception. In any case, there is only one way to find out.","TEXT_LUCKBA251_03272_SEQ_01<tab>Sophrosyne est apparue dans le village nain pendant que vous n'étiez pas là et a ranimé le purgateur que Giott avait abattu à l'entrée de la galerie des Condamnés.
