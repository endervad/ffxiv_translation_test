You'll forgive me for the sudden correspondence, and the secrecy. You helped me, in a way. Once upon a time. It's past time I said as much, and so...here we are.
Feels like a lifetime ago, come to think on it. You've been through quite a lot since then─accomplished incredible things. I'd like to think that, in some way, I was a part of your journey... Far from the best, no doubt. But for me and my own journey, I think it safe to say that you've been...well. There's no suitable words to describe it, really.
I've done things. Made decisions. Looking back, I can't help but feel more than a little foolish. But such is life, and we have to seize what few opportunities we have for closure...even if it is through the written word and not face<var 1F /var>to<var 1F /var>face.
So wherever you are, I hope you're happy. Still fighting, still adventuring─still doing what you love. Be well.“
