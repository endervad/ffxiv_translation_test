昏倒した「暁」の賢人たちは依然として目を覚まさず、国境地帯ギムリトにて開かれた、エオルゼア同盟軍と帝国軍との戦況は膠着状態にあった。そこに、ゼノスの顔を持つ男が降り立ち、駆けつけた冒険者との激戦が繰り広げられる。冒険者は善戦するものの、謎の呼び声が響き渡って倒れてしまう。そして、呼び声の主からクリスタルタワーで装置を探すよう告げられるのだった。イシュガルドで目を覚ました冒険者は、エスティニアンによって窮地を救われたこと、戦況が再び膠着状態に陥り、盟主たちが冒険者を休ませる方針にしたことを知る。冒険者は石の家に戻り、タタルに呼び声の主のことを話すと、彼女は「暁」の冒険者たちと共にクリスタルタワーの装置を探すと意気込むのだった。
