"","TEXT_LUCKBA111_03244_SEQ_04<tab>Although Granson's inquiries were equally unproductive, he is at least finally willing to reveal his connection to the village─his village, it would seem. A year ago, he was still a humble game hunter living happily with his bride-to-be, a goldsmith who had been hard at work restoring an antique bracelet. Alas, when he returned from the shipyards with supplies for her work, he found the village in disarray, for Dikaiosyne had come and set about killing and corrupting all who crossed his path─including Milinda, Granson's beloved, who was transformed into a sin eater before his very eyes. Afterwards, Dikaiosyne wordlessly scooped up the antique bracelet and quit the village with his horde of eater followers, but not before the hunter was forced to put Milinda out of her misery. It was this tragedy which set Granson on the path he now walks, for only by taking his revenge on the eater which destroyed his life will his soul ever know peace.

Il y a environ un an, le purgateur a attaqué Cherpant, où Granson vivait alors avec sa petite amie Milinda. Puis il a disparu en emportant, sans motif apparent, un bracelet ancien appelé le Croc du Loup à deux têtes, que la jeune femme devait réparer pour un brocanteur d'Eulmore. Non content d'avoir assisté, impuissant, à la transformation de sa promise en monstre, Granson a été contraint de lui ôter la vie... De cet épisode tragique est né un farouche désir de vengeance, qu'il est allé jusqu'à graver dans sa chair sous la forme d'une balafre... Granson va à présent poursuivre son enquête à Cherpant.
