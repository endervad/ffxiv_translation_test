He explains that the hammers are creating a foundation on which estates for Ul'dahns of considerable means are to be built. Of course, not everybody is excited at this proposition, such as the Silver Bazaar's own Kikipu. It would seem that not everybody's idea of progress is the same.</target>

Once he has the grease, he can use it to keep the hammers running. It couldn't be more simple!</target>
