He claims that not only is the young man surly and uncommunicative, but that he also refuses to dig in the same locations as his colleagues, instead opting for those that have little chance of yielding anything of value. Horthur senses that as Kee-Satt is unwilling to confide in any of his peers, he may be more likely to share his troubles with an outsider such as yourself.
