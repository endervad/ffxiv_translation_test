Her tentative plan is to interrogate local residents for sightings of the errant starship in an attempt to divine the missing Manderville man's current location. To that end, she has handed you a visual aid─an illustration of said starship─and enlisted you to expand the range of the investigation. The Landsguard stationed at Brightploom Post may be best equipped to handle any questions regarding unusual airborne vessels.</target>

Nashu is nevertheless confident that he is the missing inspector, theorizing that the man's ungentlemanly manner is the result of shock from the crash. Although adamant that a healthy dose of her “medicine” will put him to rights, she heeds your call for restraint and settles for following the man in the overcoat from a distance...for now.</target>

While a second round of treatment (this time disguised as a hard-boiled egg) confirms the characteristic uncanny Manderville indestructibility, his pulpy demeanor nevertheless remains unchanged. This fact, along with the physical resemblance, leads you to suspect he shares a soul with the Hildibrand of the Source. Though confused and a little disappointed, Nashu concedes that you likely have the wrong man. The detective, for his part, is intrigued by your talk of a missing person, and Nashu eagerly accepts his offer to work on the case.</target>
