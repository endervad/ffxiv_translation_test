Delighted, the young Pelupelu quickly launches into a proposal, offering you the role of special advisor for her new venture, the Turali Travel Agency. She does not expect an immediate response, though, and requests that you visit her in the Kozama'uka village of Ok'hanu should you wish to know more.

Moreover, this venture would help to revitalize Kozama'uka, which is still in the process of rebuilding following the recent great storm. Liplu wishes to further explain her plans, however.</target>
