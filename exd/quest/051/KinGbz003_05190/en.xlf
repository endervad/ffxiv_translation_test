As if summoned by this remark, your five companions during the search for the treasures walk into Xbalyav Ty'e. Apparently, they just returned from following a suspicious group from Tuliyollal to Shaaloani, and surmise that they may very well be the enforcers Apyaahi intends for you to meet. Ceetol Ja suggests splitting up, with her group going to Shaaloani to find out the details of Apyaahi's plan, and the other working to uncover the secrets of her treasure. Kuiyki asks to join her on her trek to Shaaloani, and apparently has a plan that will make the mission easier─which of course, involves you.</target>
