        <target state="final">TEXT_BANKOB307_01370_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Bo Bu is incensed at Zo Ga's mining methods, which involve the fugleman employing his considerable resources and influence to open new veins of ore and bleed them dry before handing them over to lesser orders. In the latest effort to that end, he has employed diggers fashioned for him under duress by the accomplished metalworkers of the 86th Order. At the dustman's request, consult with Ba Go and find a way to thwart Zo Ga's efforts and narrow the gap between the haves and have&lt;var 1F /var&gt;nots.</target>

Seek out the Model 86 digger in U'Ghamaro and lay the coals beside it.</target>
