        <target state="final">TEXT_BANSAH205_01394_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Four crates of stolen armaments have been deposited in the Sapsa Spawning Grounds by the Serpent Reavers, and they await collection by the Coral Tridents. The armaments need but a spark to go up in flames, and Houu has given you several flint stones to accomplish this purpose. Should guards of the shelftooth, shelfclaw, or shelfspine persuasion attempt to interfere, lay them low.</target>

There does seem, however, to be some strange sympathy for the devil in that slow-beating heart...</target>
