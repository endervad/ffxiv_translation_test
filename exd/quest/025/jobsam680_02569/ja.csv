"","TEXT_JOBSAM680_02569_SEQ_08<tab>Makoto confesses all to you. She and Ugetsu were born into a samurai family in the capital, and from a tender age her brother exhibited great talent in the katana. Musosai took him as his pupil, and together they took to the road for his training. But the Ugetsu who returned was a changed man, one filled with anger and despair both, who dreamed of toppling the bakufu. The situation came to a head when he assassinated Hingan dignitaries, a crime for which his entire family paid with their lives─all except for Kagetsu herself, who managed to escape. Thereafter she journeyed to Kugane, where she took the name Makoto and knocked on the Sekiseigumi's doors. Since that time, she has lived to punish her brother, but even as his cause grows in strength, hers only weakens on account of the blood she shares with Ugetsu. With the captain gone, she has naught to depend upon save her own conviction...and you.
