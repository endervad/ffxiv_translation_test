As if spurred to action, the memory of Shatotto stirs, and dashes off with Lalai's corporeal body in tow to see to the threat as only she knows how.

As she tells it, two millennia ago when she still lived, a wayward comet threatened to crash into the city of Mhach─a crisis averted by the power of black magic, an art which she had devised at least in part for that very task. Fragments that broke off the comet hurtled to the earth, and were later unearthed, affording the mages of the realm untold powers. There remains, however, a further complication. Shatotto posits that the stones call out to each other with aetheric signals, augmenting each other's power─a phenomenon which could result in disaster should the comet once again draw near, as Shatotto predicts will happen in the days to come.
