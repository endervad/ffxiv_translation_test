Long ago, guided by a vision received by her grandmother, she ventured into the southern mountains and there found Hien, near death. Cirina brought the Doman lord to her village, where they nursed him back to health, and there he has remained ever since, until such time as he can repay his debt to them. He often accompanies her to Reunion, though he has a habit of frequenting a spot atop the cliff to the east of the marketplace...","TEXT_STMBDA403_02502_SEQ_01<tab>Auf eurer Suche nach Hien macht ihr die Bekanntschaft mit Cirina, einer jungen Mol, die den Prinzen einst halb tot in der Wüste auffand und ihn in ihrer Siedlung gesund pflegte.
