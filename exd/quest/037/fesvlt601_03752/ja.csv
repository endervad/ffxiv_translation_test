"","TEXT_FESVLT601_03752_SEQ_01<tab>Lady Lisette de Valentione greets you and welcomes you to the Valentione's Day festivities, which have returned to Gridania anew this year. Though she wishes nothing more than to spread ardor and affection─as her house words are writ─across all of Eorzea, she finds herself in the midst of a most disheartening dispute. To wit, her three would-be protégés─including her sister Astrid, to whom Lisette is partial─are bickering over which of them most deserves to assume the role of emissary of love for this year's festival. To that end, Lady Lisette proposes a contest: the three will listen to the plight of a lovelorn Gridanian and each offer their advice, after which a vote will be held, and the most insightful and inspired of the three declared the victor. Tasked with seeing that the competition proceeds with due impartiality, you agree to accompany the three would-be emissaries to interview their subject.
