"","TEXT_LUCKRA204_03790_SEQ_02<tab>Urianger's explanation of the plan to restore the ice element is soon interrupted by Gaia, who is none too pleased to hear that it may take decades for the Empty to be restored. Upon hearing that the endeavor is for the benefit of future generations, Gaia, clearly moved by your selfless deeds, finally begins to open up, expressing her innermost doubts and fears. Her thoughts are soon interrupted by what appears to be a sudden headache, and she absents herself, heading outside for some fresh air. The others express their growing concern for her well-being, and Thancred suggests that you go to check on her. You arrive on Eden's canopy to find Gaia lost in a reverie, and the situation takes a dramatic turn for the worse when a dark aura manifests around her and coalesces into an ominous floating glyph. At that moment, countless flying sin eaters appear from nowhere and begin circling above Eden, with the glyph at their center, though rather than attacking this dark entity, they seem to be in its thrall. With Gaia now rendered immobile and entirely defenseless, you have no choice but to take her to Eden's core and decide how best to approach this unforeseen threat.","TEXT_LUCKRA204_03790_SEQ_02<tab>ウリエンジェと話した。氷属性の励起が完了しても、すぐに世界が元通りになるわけではないようだ。そのことに不満を感じたガイアが、エデン甲板へと飛び出してしまう。様子を観に行った冒険者が目撃したのは、大量の罪喰いに襲われて気を失う彼女の姿だった。なんとかガイアを保護したものの、いまだ外は大量の罪喰いに囲まれている。エデンコアの「リーン」と話そう。","","False","0x00000002","",""
