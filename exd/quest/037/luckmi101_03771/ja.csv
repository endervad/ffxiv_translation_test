水晶公に召喚された「暁の血盟」の仲間たちを原初世界に返すため、魂と記憶を入れる魔具「ソウル・サイフォン」の製作を進める冒険者たち。一方で、死んだはずのアルバートが人々の前に姿を現し、新たな「光の戦士」を目指せと促しはじめる。かつての英雄の復活を不審に思った一行は、それが本物のアルバートではなく、彼の遺体に憑依したアシエン・エリディブスだということを突き止めた。彼は和解の余地はないと語りつつも、人々の「光の戦士」への目覚めを促し続けるのだった。

His class duly assembled, Moren proceeds to explain that, despite sharing no apparent connection, many individuals have been hailed as Warriors of Light throughout Vrandtic history, and that in time the title came to be a synonym for hero. Intrigued, Alphinaud observes that the epithet is similarly used in the Source, and posits that Hydaelyn is likely the common thread. As you ponder what this might imply, you are interrupted by a little girl's excited voice followed by the rumble of tumbling tomes. You turn towards the commotion to find three Crystarium younglings, a shame-faced Riqi-Tio and her friends Arkil and Eirwel, whom Moren wastes no time chastising for their lack of care. Upon realizing she is in the presence of the great Warrior of Darkness, however, Riqi-Tio's chagrin reverts to excitement, and she can barely contain herself as she asks you what she must do to become a hero─or “Warrior of Light.”","TEXT_LUCKMI101_03771_SEQ_02<tab>モーレンから光の戦士にまつわる話を聞いた。博物陳列館の「リキ・ティオ」と話そう。","","False","0x00000002","",""
