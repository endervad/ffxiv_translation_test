"","TEXT_AKTKRA203_04637_SEQ_01<tab>At his son's prompting, a surprisingly cooperative Lahabrea explains that Hephaistos was an experiment born of his own negative emotions, meant to remain sealed away forevermore. While he does not know how his so-called “other half” came to roam the facility unfettered, he concludes that the best means to keep him from wreaking further havoc is to destroy Pandæmonium before the barriers surrounding it are undone. Following Erichthonios's stringent objection to this course, Themis invokes his position as Emissary to advocate for continued investigation of the facility, that the warders might yet be saved. Lahabrea begrudgingly accepts this decision, but states that he will not hesitate to move forward with Pandæmonium's erasure if you are unequal to the task.
