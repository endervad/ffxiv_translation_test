"","TEXT_FESVLT901_04654_SEQ_01<tab>Lisette de Valentione, vaunted emissary of love and ardor, is having sister trouble─to wit, said sister is being stubbornly insistent that she relieve Lisette of her Valentione's Day duties this year. Upon further inquiry, you discover that her demand stems from a desire to allow Lisette time with her own beloved during this season of romance. After you pledge your support to Astrid, Lisette finally consents to her younger sister's wishes, counseling her to stay true to her heart as she fulfills her duty as an emissary of affection.

Now wearing her sister's proverbial shoes, Astrid asks you to accompany her colleague, an emissary-in-training named Emilie, on a promotional tour around Gridania. You speak to Emilie to get started, but not before you take note of the cheerful determination on Astrid's face─and her uncharacteristically frilly outfit.
