Laurenssen has come to Eorzea in pursuit of the truth─to wit, the origin of Starlight reindeer symbolism.

You set off to gather a crowd of younglings, but Blitzen, the reindeer at the crux of this operation, shakes his head dolefully, seemingly less than enthusiastic...

Он прибыл в Эорзию в поисках истины — а именно, происхождения символизма оленей Звёздного Света. Он надеется без тени сомнения доказать, что мудрые олени когда-то радовали маленьких детей иллюзиями, и ему требуется помощь от такого весёлого искателя приключений, как вы, чтобы подготовить почву для своего эксперимента. Вы отправляетесь собирать толпу детей, но Блитцен, олень, на котором держится вся эта затея, уныло качает головой и, кажется, не испытывает особого энтузиазма...
