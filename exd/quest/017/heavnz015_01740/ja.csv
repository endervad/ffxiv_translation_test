"","TEXT_HEAVNZ015_01740_SEQ_01<tab>Gildon is beside himself with disappointment at the state of affairs at Camp Cloudtop. As he tells it, the men and women stationed there are those found to be of little or no use elsewhere. This subtle form of demotion has left them disheartened, carrying out their duties with an empty sense of obligation. But Gildon is determined to reignite the fire in their bellies with proper nourishment. To achieve this goal, however, he must convince the quartermaster Fabrellet to make reforms to the shipment and distribution of provisions. Gildon believes Fabrellet will not listen to him, but may lend his ear to a reputable adventurer. Speak with Fabrellet, and see if he might relent on the issue.","TEXT_HEAVNZ015_01740_SEQ_01<tab>ギルドンは、食事の改善をするよう補給係のファブルレーを説得してほしいと頼んできた。アバラシア雲海のキャンプ・クラウドトップにいる「ファブルレー」と話そう。","","False","0x00000001","",""
