"","TEXT_CHRHDB301_01438_SEQ_01<tab>Inspector's Log:
I have arrived in Costa del Sol. Somewhere in the realm, the masked fiend I pursue sets a leering eye on a poor, defenseless young maiden─a case that cries out for a gentleman inspector, if ever there were one. Employing my own stupendous powers of disguise, I have concealed myself among a group of Brass Blades, hoping to ascertain the identity of the “lapis maiden” mentioned by the thief. Thus far, I have gleaned little save for war stories and tales of drinking prowess, but I am certain it is only a matter of time before the answer is within my grasp!
　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*
Employing her finely honed reporter's senses, Ellie has tracked down the identity of the lapis maiden─the daughter of a prominent Ul'dahn trader by the name of Arabella whose beauty has been the talk of the town, despite no one having actually seen her in the flesh. She further explains that the maiden has recently been betrothed to the son of a Lominsan trading mogul, and is to make a rare public appearance at a banquet to be held in the couple's honor. Surmising that the thief is likely to strike, Ellie declares her intention to travel to Costa del Sol and speak with the bride's father, Guguremu, and invites you to come along.","TEXT_CHRHDB301_01438_SEQ_01<tab>前回までの冒険録：
