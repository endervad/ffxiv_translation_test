For now, it falls to you to fully infuse the sphere scroll. If you would wield a mightier relic, see the deed done, then present the scroll to Jalzahn.

※Each materia infusion requires the use of alexandrite, a catalyst yielded from treasure coffers whose locations are marked on <var 48 F201F4 /var><var 49 F201F5 /var>mysterious maps<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>.
※Mysterious maps can be obtained from Auriana at Revenant's Toll in exchange for Allagan tomestones, or by completing a certain quest. Alexandrite may also be obtained by participating in FATEs while equipped with your relic weapon (animus or beyond).
※The enhancement process will raise your relic weapon animus's strength, dexterity, vitality, intelligence, and mind attributes to a value befitting gear of item level 110. Attributes that remain will be replaced with the ones infused into the sphere scroll. In the case of Thyrus Animus and Omnilex Animus, base direct hit rate will not be replaced.","TEXT_JOBREL004_01464_SEQ_02<tab>ジャルザーンは、ウベールタンの考えた手法に感心しているようだ。「スフィアスクロール」に十分な転写を行い、「古の武器・アニムス」と「スフィアスクロール」をジャルザーンに渡そう。

※マテリアの力の転写には、「謎めいた地図」で見つかる宝箱から入手できる、「アレキサンドライト」が必要となります。「謎めいた地図」は、レヴナンツトールのオーリアナからアラガントームストーンと交換。または、一部のクエストの報酬で入手できます。なお、「アレキサンドライト」は、宝箱のほかにも、「古の武器・アニムス」以降の武器を装備した状態で、各地のF.A.T.E.に参加して貢献することでも、稀に入手できます。

※「古の武器・アニムス」を強化すると、「古の武器・アニムス」についていた、「STR」「DEX」「VIT」「INT」「MND」の各パラメータ。また「タイラス・アニムス」と「マダレムジエン・アニムス」についていた「ダイレクトヒット」以外のパラメータは、「スフィアスクロール」に転写されたパラメータに置き換わります。置き換わらないパラメータについては、強化にともない、「アイテムレベル110」に適した値に引き上げられます。","","False","0x00000002","",""
