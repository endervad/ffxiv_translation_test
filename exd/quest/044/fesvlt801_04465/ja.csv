"","TEXT_FESVLT801_04465_SEQ_01<tab>Kupka Kupp, emissary of ardor and affection, finds himself overtaxed this Valentione's Day. To aid in his deliveries, his postmoogle betters have provided him with a fledgling courier by the name of Pukty Piko who, unfortunately, is ignorant in the ways of the heart. This postmoogle's cynicism is so dire, in fact, it threatens to spoil these romantic festivities entirely. To rectify the situation, Lisette takes it upon herself to enlist both you and Astrid in the aid of this hopeless moogle. The two of you are to accompany Pukty as she makes her rounds, all the while instructing her in the myriad meanings of love. Having assented to this scheme, the postmoogle and her chocobo companion make for their first delivery at the Carpenters' Guild, where she awaits you.
