To your surprise, it was none other than Fandaniel who shed light upon the phenomenon of the Final Days, and thence dedicated himself to devising a countermeasure. Prior to joining the Convocation, he served as the chief of Elpis─a facility for the evaluation of creations─and was known as Hermes. Perhaps inspired by an impossible memory of you in that ancient time and place, Elidibus suggests that you travel to Elpis in the past.
