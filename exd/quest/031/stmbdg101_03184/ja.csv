クルルとマトーヤの協力を得ても、賢人たちの昏倒の謎は解明できなかった。一方、ザ・バーンに防御フィールド「青龍壁」を展開することに成功するが、影の狩人が昏睡したアルフィノを抱えて現れる。彼の正体は、かつての第XIV軍団軍団長のガイウス。ガイウスは暗躍するアシエンの情報を伝えると、帝国へと去っていく。そして、停戦交渉に応じたヴァリス帝との会談が行われる。帝国がアシエンによって建国されたこと、ヴァリス帝が故意に霊災を起こそうとしていることが判明し、交渉は決裂。国境地帯ギムリトにてエオルゼア同盟軍と帝国軍との戦端が開かれる。冒険者や東方連合の活躍によって、帝国軍の第一陣は退けるが、またも謎の声が響き渡り、アリゼーが倒れてしまうのだった。
