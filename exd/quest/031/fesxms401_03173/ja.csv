"","TEXT_FESXMS401_03173_SEQ_03<tab>Maisenta introduces you to the Homunculi, the musicians who will be gracing the Starlight Celebration. As talented as they are, their lack of familiarity with Ishgardian choral music led them to seek the aid of a composer, rather than attempt to write the songs themselves. Unfortunately for them, the manuscripts they received state that two female and two male singers are required, with highly specific─not to mention extremely cryptic─instructions as to the tone of their voices. Since there is little time to search for experienced female vocalists, it is decided that Maisenta and Amh Garanjy will fill the roles, with Augustiniel of the Homunculi assigned as one of the two males. In addition to choosing members for the choir, it seems that Maisenta has need of someone to collect a conductor's baton from the Carpenters' Guild and an order of choir surplices from the Weavers' Guild. Since Maisenta and the Homunculi are otherwise engaged, you are left as the only available candidate for the task.","TEXT_FESXMS401_03173_SEQ_03<tab>マイセンタから話を聞いた。聖歌隊の手配に手間取っているらしく、合唱に必要な用品の調達を手伝ってほしいと頼まれた。木工師ギルドにいる「ベアティヌ」と、ウルダハの裁縫師ギルドの「レドレント・ローズ」からそれぞれ、「<var 28 ((EventItem)) F61E8E3E01 /var>」と「<var 28 ((EventItem)) F61E8E3F01 /var>」を受け取ろう。","","False","0x00000003","",""

When Maisenta and the Homunculi arrive, they have another surprise in store for Amh Garanjy: She has been selected─without her knowledge─as a member of the choir. Maisenta pays little heed to Amh Garanjy's initial reluctance and quickly moves on to the topic of the final member. The discussion is over almost as soon as it begins with the arrival of Baenfaeld, a hulking Roegadyn with a voice so deep one might mistake it for the lowing of an immense aurochs. Thankfully, he agrees to join the choir with only minimal persuasion required. Now that all four members have been chosen, Amh Garanjy reminds the group that they still have a conductor's baton without an owner. Once again, you demonstrate a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and find yourself involuntarily volunteered for the role of directing the performance.","TEXT_FESXMS401_03173_SEQ_05<tab>アム・ガランジと話した。冒険者の活躍のおかげで、無事に音楽会を開催できるようだ。音楽会には指揮者として参加できるようなので、星芒祭実行委員のベーンフェールドに話を聞いてみるのもいいだろう。","","False","0x00000005","",""
