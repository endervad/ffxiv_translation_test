Unable to restrain himself, Inspector Hildibrand reveals himself and implores his father to break free of the drug's thrall. Alas, this only serves to draw his attention to Shigure, Greg, and the Wolf Burglar, who are swiftly dispatched by the might of the Hammer. However, Godbert then turns on his supposed masters, apparently unable to distinguish friend from foe. And so it falls to Hildibrand Helidor Maximilian Manderville to meet the man from whose loins he sprung in mortal combat. You can but look on, mesmerized, as son launches into the air, arms wrapped around his father, as he mournfully sings the song of his house in a vain effort to wake the man he so desperately loves from his madness, only to discover to his delight and dread that performing one of the traditional Mandervillian martial techniques triggers an instinctive response─an irreversible reversal, leaving the inspector helpless before the impending onslaught...

After the dust has settled, Godbert apologizes for his excess. But in spite of the minor cataclysm, all is well. Akebono and the Han have been exposed and will face justice, and the Soboro Sukehiro, which Akebono just so happened to be carrying, can be returned to its rightful owner, the Wolf Burglar. Having avenged his father, the Lupin is content to return to his cell in Kugane, but Shigure, to everyone's surprise, insists that he leave with the sword instead. And so the Wolf Burglar departs, Soboro Sukehiro in hand, to pay his respects to the samurai who loved him as family. For a fleeting moment, it seems as though it will be an almost unreasonably happy ending for all...which is perhaps why the Hannish co-conspirator, in a fit of petulance, uses a hidden supply of dewprism to enthrall Greg and command him to spirit him far away.
