"","TEXT_FESXMS402_03174_SEQ_01<tab>While Baenfaeld is somewhat apprehensive about singing before an audience, his determination to contribute to the success of the Starlight Celebration is without question. He explains that the crowd is being divided into two groups, with a Starlight celebrant assigned to each. For better or worse, the festival staff have wildly differing approaches in their pre-perfomance banter, with one guide exaggerating the musical ability of the choir to ridiculous extremes. As a result, that particular group's expectations are considerably higher than the other, and a more complex and challenging song is required to satisfy them. Thankfully, you are free to choose which collective of spectators you will perform for first.

※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone.","TEXT_FESXMS402_03174_SEQ_01<tab>※本クエストは、シーズナルイベント開催中にかぎり、
