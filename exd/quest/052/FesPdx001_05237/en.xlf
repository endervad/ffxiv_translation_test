The young man auditioned to play the part, however, has failed to return from picking up his costume. The royal seneschal asks that you make your way to Eshtaime's Aesthetics and see what has befallen Picot, his up-and-coming star.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
