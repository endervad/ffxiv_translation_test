Accordingly, he continues, he has ordered that the area around the primal's hand be cleared, hoping to entice Illuminati operatives into revealing themselves. Scant moments later, Wedge receives word that Brayflox has been seen entering the colossus. You can only conclude that she is not who she seems.
