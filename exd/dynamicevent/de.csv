"","The Baying of the Hound(s)<tab>Following a series of resounding defeats, the imperial mages have resorted to desperate measures by summoning the ferocious Canis Dirus.

"","Vigil for the Lost<tab>The experimental magitek soldier Dabog has been assigned to pilot Vigilia, the culmination of the Empire's research into scorpion-type warmachina.

"","The Hunt for Red Choctober<tab>Unlike their yellow-plumed cousins, the red chocobo is rarely a welcome sight, least of all on the battlefield.

"","Patriot Games<tab>The Empire's magitek soldiers possess a wealth of machina with which to torment their foes, but few are more nightmarish than the Patriot.

"","Trampled under Hoof<tab>Though it may seem no more than a rather large and unsightly bovine at first glance, the eale is in fact one of the deadliest creatures at the Empire's command.
