The following pages contain a detailed explanation of what you may expect on the battlefield.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

&lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;Read and understand them well if you would gain the upper hand over the Empire's IVth Legion.&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;</target>

Though it is possible to join the Bozjan southern front beginning at level 71, all players will be synced to level 80 while in duty. Item level will also be synced accordingly.

&lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;* All job actions unlocked through level 80 will also be available while in duty.&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;</target>

All players are subject to a separate leveling system while at the front, indicated by their “Resistance rank.” Performing admirably in large-scale battles such as skirmishes and critical engagements will increase your “mettle”─akin to experience points.

&lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;* Simply defeating imperial troops and beasts is not enough to prove your mettle─you must participate in successful military operations.&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">If you demonstrate sufficient mettle upon reporting to the Resistance commander, your Resistance rank will climb. Those of higher rank will gain access to more areas of the front, as well as additional quests.

&lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;* Your Resistance rank will not increase unless authorized by the commander, so don't forget to report for inspection!&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;</target>

Upon successful completion of a military operation, you will gain regular experience points in addition to mettle. This experience will be applied to your job level as normal, so it is recommended that you consider using a job that has not yet reached level 80 to take advantage of experience point gains.</target>

Enlist the aid of &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;allied players&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; and &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;NPCs&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; alike to slay monsters, solve mysteries, and defeat the mighty boss lurking in the depths. Conquering &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;dungeons&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; is not only a time-honored tradition of adventurers, but it also &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;progresses the main scenario&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; and tests your prowess at a given class or job in a &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;timed environment&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;.

Intimidated? Fear not, dear adventurer─for with a little guidance, you too shall be clearing &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;dungeons&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; with confidence in no time!</target>

You may challenge a &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;dungeon&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; via two different methods: by calling upon &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;the support of trusty NPCs&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;, or by &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;pooling your talent with other players&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;, be they best friend or first acquaintance. No matter how you form your party, the trials that await you will be comparable in difficulty and experience.</target>

No matter how independent and capable you may be, a &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;dungeon&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; is too mighty a challenge to overcome on one's own. By choosing &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;Duty Support&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; when accessing the entrance of any applicable &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;dungeon&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;, you will summon a balanced &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;team of skilled NPCs&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; to support you on your path to glory. Just don't forget them once you're rich and famous, yes?</target>

All that's left is to select &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;Register for Duty&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;, and you will be battling monsters in no time.</target>

They say a burden shared is a burden halved, and with the &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;Duty Finder&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; you can split that burden amongst a team of players who smolder with the same passion for &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;adventure&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; as you do! No need to recruit such teammates yourself─the &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;Duty Finder&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;'s matching system will automatically group players according to chosen challenge and other criteria, guaranteeing a balanced and invigorating cooperative experience for all.</target>

Once you have been matched with a party, you will be notified by a &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;bracing sound&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; that the time for battle is at hand! Simply select &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;Commence&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;, and you and your comrades will be delivered unto the fray.

Remember─the adventurers with whom you are cooperating are fellow &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;players&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;. Take advantage of the full and varied strengths your group possesses by communicating respectfully and often. </target>

As your journey progresses, more and more &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;dungeons&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; will become available, until you find yourself master of a sea of tribulations overcome. But don't let completion deter you from &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;challenging your favorite duties again&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;─simply open &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;Duty Support&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; to play through &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;dungeons you've cleared&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;, or use the &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;Duty Finder&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; to do the same with &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;dungeons not yet supported by the NPC party system&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;. No matter your craving, you're guaranteed to find an adventure to satisfy.</target>

While this introduction of &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;dungeons&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; has no doubt been immortalized within the hallowed halls of your mind, if you find yourself in need of a refresher, you may &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;access tutorial information&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; again by selecting the &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;?&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; icon in the &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;Duty Support&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; or &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;Duty Finder&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; windows.

&lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;Variant dungeons&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; are a unique type of duty featuring &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;branching paths&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;. By exploring these choices alongside the quest character, you will gradually reveal new elements of the overarching story.

Unlocking certain branches may require some detective work! Whenever you complete a path, a new story entry will be added to the journal associated with the dungeon, so keep at it until you discover all the forks in the road.</target>

The difficulty of a variant dungeon is &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;automatically adjusted&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; to provide a challenge for parties of between one to four players. 

You can group up with friends, make use of the party matching option, or put your solo player skills to the test. Victory will require effort and attention, but it is entirely possible to complete these dungeons alone. </target>

To allow for greater freedom in role choices, variant dungeons grant players the use of special &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;variant actions&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;.

These actions mimic existing abilities such as &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;Cure&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; or &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;Rampart&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;, alleviating the need for dedicated tanks, DPS, or healers. Each player has two actions available for use during the dungeon, and these can be changed at any time in the Dungeon Finder window.</target>

You can enter a variant dungeon via the &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;V&amp;C Dungeon Finder window&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;, which is accessed by speaking with the &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;NPC at the dungeon entrance&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;, or by selecting the option from &lt;var 48 0F /var&gt;Duty&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; in the main menu.
