3. Assemble material at assembly site

Yes, yes, I realize you'd essentially be building a monument to yourselves, but by now you ought to know we wouldn't trust the job to anyone else!

Augebert<tab>","Our work's more or less done, but there's one more thing I'd like everyone's help on: a monument to honor those who made the reconstruction possible.

We're planning to erect this at the Abacus like so:
1. Obtain material from supply pile
2. Process material at work station
3. Assemble material at assembly site

Yes, yes, I realize you'd essentially be building a monument to yourselves, but by now you ought to know we wouldn't trust the job to anyone else!

"","Ours has been a long road, but we have reached our destination. We have completed the reconstruction of the Firmament. And though this is by any measure a remarkable feat, we have not simply rebuilt structures. We have rebuilt lives. And beside the honor of working with such a gathering of fine folk, this is what fills me with the greatest pride.

We could not have accomplished this without the tireless efforts of all involved. No words will suffice to express my gratitude, but I wish to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Till fate next sees fit to bring us together again, I wish you every success.
