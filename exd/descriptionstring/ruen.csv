Players begin with 13 tiles and draw a new tile each turn. They must then choose a tile to discard: either the new tile or one of the tiles in their hand. The player to the right then takes a turn, and the process is repeated until the end of the hand.

The first player to complete a winning hand is awarded points. A total of eight hands are played in a full match and four in a quick match, and the player who finishes with the most points is declared the winner.
Here is an example of a winning hand:","","","False","0x00000021","",""

After declaring riichi, that player can no longer put drawn tiles into their hand. Any tiles drawn will automatically be discarded until a tile that completes the winning hand is obtained. However, a winning hand achieved through riichi is a yaku in itself. Therefore, the player does not need to have formed any other yaku to complete a winning hand.","","","False","0x00000047","",""
"","■ Properties of Riichi
　1. The player's hand automatically becomes a yaku, regardless of whether it contains any other yaku.
　2. The other players know that the one declaring riichi is one tile away from a winning hand.
　3. The declaring player cannot replace any of the tiles in their hand.

"","■ Round-specific Conditions
A game of Doman mahjong is divided into eight hands. The first round, in which the role of dealer passes to each player once, is called “East.” A triplet of east wind tiles forms a yaku in this round. The second round, “South,” allows a yaku to be formed with a triplet of south wind tiles.","","","False","0x0000004D","",""
"","■ Seat-specific Conditions
Each player is assigned a “seat wind” according to their seating position in relation to the dealer.

　Dealer = East
　Dealer's right = South
　Opposite the dealer = West
　Dealer's left = North

The seat wind for each player changes counterclockwise in this order: East, South, West, North. (This layout differs from the standard compass directions.) A triplet of wind tiles with the current seat wind forms a yaku.
The seat wind rotates together with the role of dealer, and players have a chance to easily form a yaku by paying attention to their seat wind marker.","","","False","0x0000004E","",""
"","11. Pon and Chi","","","False","0x0000004F","",""
"","It is difficult to form a winning hand relying solely on drawn tiles. However, tiles discarded by other players can be claimed by using “pon” and “chi.”","","","False","0x00000050","",""
"","■ Pon
If you have a pair of matching tiles, when another player discards a tile that can be used to form a triplet, you may call pon to claim the tile.","","","False","0x00000051","",""

Calling chi allows you to claim a number tile discarded by another player and complete a straight. However, it can only be called for the player whose turn comes before yours.","","","False","0x00000052","",""

"","■ Drawback 1: Revealing Your Hand
Using pon or chi to form a triplet or straight will cause it to be revealed to the other players. In addition, you can no longer use those tiles for any other melds.
This can lead to missing opportunities to form better hands as a result of having those tiles locked into a triplet or straight.","","","False","0x00000054","",""
"","■ Drawback 2: Preventing Riichi
It is not possible to declare riichi after using pon or chi.
Due to being unable to form a riichi yaku, you must find a way to form a different yaku. There are also certain yaku that can only be formed on the condition that you have not used pon or chi, so these will also become unavailable.

"","In each hand, certain tiles are selected as “dora” and will grant bonus han simply for being included in a winning hand. While dora apply han bonuses, they are not in themselves yaku, so a yaku must be formed in order to take advantage of dora.","","","False","0x00000057","",""
"","■ Dora
A dora tile is randomly selected at the start of each hand and is displayed throughout.","","","False","0x00000058","",""

"","■ Ura Dora
When calling a winning hand after declaring riichi, the “ura dora” is revealed. This is only shown after the winning hand has been called and is nothing more than a surprise bonus, although it provides added incentive to try declaring riichi.

"","Since there are four of each tile, it is possible to collect all four. This is known as “kan.”","","","False","0x0000005C","",""
"","Although kan is not in itself a yaku, it awards additional bonuses when calculating the points earned by a winning hand. Kan also increases the number of dora, which may offer further advantages.

※Permission to leave messages will reset every day at <var 06 01 /var><var 08 DB ((<var 09 DB02030405060708090A0B0C0D02030405060708090A0B0C /var>)) 0D /var> <var 08 E0DB0D ((p.m.)) ((a.m.)) /var> (Earth time).

■Deleting a Message
Messages can also be deleted by the player who penned them, as well as by the estate owner and those with authorization.

■Liking a Message Book
Before leaving an estate, visitors can show their love of the house and its décor by leaving a “like” in the message book.
Characters are granted ten likes to distribute upon first viewing a message book, and accumulate an additional five likes per day at <var 06 01 /var><var 08 DB ((<var 09 DB02030405060708090A0B0C0D02030405060708090A0B0C /var>)) 0D /var> <var 08 E0DB0D ((p.m.)) ((a.m.)) /var> (Earth time) up to a maximum of fifty.

You must also select a retainer to serve as merchant before you can place the mannequin. One retainer may serve as merchant for multiple mannequins. Gil earned from the sale of items equipped to the mannequin will be entrusted to the corresponding retainer.

The number of mannequins allowed varies according to the estate type.

■Selling Items Equipped to Mannequins
Access the mannequin and choose “Select gear to sell” to open the Mannequin Shop Settings window. Only sellable items in your inventory, Armoury Chest, or retainer inventory may be selected.

Any items equipped on a mannequin that are listed for sale still occupy slots in the retainer's list. For that reason, a mannequin cannot be equipped with items that would cause the retainer to exceed the 20 item limit.

■Selling as a Set
By checking “Sell Only as Set,” you can sell all items equipped to the mannequin together. While the items may be viewed on the market board, a player must access the mannequin directly if they wish to purchase the set.

When viewing items listed on the market board as part of a set, it is possible to send a tell to the seller to ascertain the location of their estate. 
※Please be aware that it is possible to view the name of a character selling a set through the market board.

■Displaying Gear
You may also display items on a mannequin without listing the gear for sale. It is also possible to select unsellable items for display.
※The mannequin cannot be used to display glamoured items.

However, gear that is displayed also occupies slots in the retainer's list of items for sale on the market, despite not being available for purchase.

■Retaliation
Incapacitated players will be returned to their Grand Company's landing, where they will be allowed to rejoin combat after a short delay. This will not incur a weakness penalty.
Furthermore, players will be temporarily invulnerable when leaving their Grand Company's landing.

■Mounts
Players are free to use mounts during Frontline campaigns. However, players taking damage while mounted will be afflicted with the Limp status effect.

Using Return will teleport players back to their landing point. Moreover, this action has no recast time during Frontline campaigns. Please note, however, casting will be interrupted by attacks.

■KDA
Each time a player incapacitates an enemy player, they are awarded a knockout (K). When a player is incapacitated, they are classed as “down” (D). If a player deals damage to an enemy that is then incapacitated by a teammate, they are awarded an assist (A). The final K, D, and A for each player is displayed on the results screen at the end of the battle.

An Open tournament consists of three matches, with participants earning points based on the outcome of each game: 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and zero points for a loss. At the culmination of the third match, the participant with the most points is declared the victor.

In addition to victory points, the final number of captured cards is also recorded for each match. In the case that participants end the tournament with equal points, the player who most dominated the card grid over the course of the competition is awarded a higher ranking.

With the exception of Draft, basic tournaments have no advanced rules in play. All that is required to enjoy these matches is an understanding of the standard Triple Triad rules.

Advanced tournaments are for players who prefer their card battles with an extra layer of complexity. In addition to Draft, these contests will also feature advanced rules such as Same or Plus.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>■Riser■<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
The sub-levels within each tier are called “risers.” The number of risers varies per tier, with three risers each for Bronze and Silver, four for Gold and Platinum, and five within the Diamond tier. Unlike tiers, it is possible to drop down to a lower riser.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>■Rising Stars■<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
When you win a ranked match, you will gain one Rising Star. Similarly, a loss will remove one Star. Once you have earned the maximum three Rising Stars in one riser, an additional win will allow you to move up a riser.

To begin, enable Feed mode from the islekeep's index, then approach an animal in the pasture equipped with the feed item of your choice to give it the tasty treat it deserves.

Feeding an animal will improve its mood and sate its appetite.

■Feed
There are three different types of animal feed available:
island sweetfeed, island greenfeed, and premium island greenfeed.

Each feed can be crafted via the Sanctuary Crafting Log, and both types of greenfeed require produce yielded from the cropland.

■Food
Animals have the following four stages of appetite:
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>“Stuffed,” “Satisfied,” “Hungry,” and “Starving.”<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
An animal's appetite increases with time, and its mood worsens in parallel.

Any type of feed can satiate an animal until it is stuffed, and animals cannot be fed if already stuffed.

■Mood
Animals have the following five moods:
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>“Hostile,” “Unhappy,” “Content,” “Chipper,” and “Gleeful.”<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
When an animal is starving, its mood will become hostile. Nourish animals in your care with food to improve their mood, and you may gather more leavings─among other boons!─in return.

Unlike appetite, an animal's mood is affected by the type of feed given to it.

Для начала включите режим «Кормить» основном меню острова, затем подойдите к животному на пастбище, снабженному выбранным вами кормом для животных, чтобы дать ему заслуженное лакомство.

Кормление животного улучшит его настроение и утолит аппетит.

■Корм
Существует три различных типа корма для животных:
island sweetfeed, island greenfeed и premium island greenfeed.

Каждый вид корма можно изготовить через журнал ремесел в святилище, а для изготовления обоих видов корма требуются продукты, получаемые с пахотных земель.

■Еда
Животные имеют следующие четыре стадии аппетита:
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var> «Сытый», «Удовлетворённый», «Голодный» и «Страдающий».<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
Аппетит животного со временем увеличивается, и вместе с ним ухудшается его настроение.

Любой вид корма может насытить животное, пока оно не наестся, а если животное уже наелось, его нельзя накормить.

■Настроение
У животных есть следующие пять настроений:
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var> «Враждебное», «Недовольное», «Довольное», «Бодрое» и «Радостное». <var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
Когда животное голодает, его настроение становится враждебным. Накормите животных, находящихся на вашем попечении, едой, чтобы улучшить их настроение, и вы сможете получить взамен больше материалов!

В отличие от аппетита, на настроение животного влияет вид корма, который ему дают.

The more popular an item is, the higher it will sell for.

Popularity may change at the beginning of a new season, but it will remain constant throughout that season.

・Supply
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Items will be in one of the following fives stages of supply: Nonexistent, Insufficient, Sufficient, Surplus, and Overflowing.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>

The less abundant an item is, the higher it will sell for.

Furthermore, the supply of handicrafts may change each cycle according to both commercial trends in Limsa Lominsa and the type/amount of items you sell from your island.

You can check shifts in demand from the previous cycle to the current one by referencing the “Demand Shift” column of the Supply & Demand interface.

If you produce too much of the same product, the market will be inundated with it, causing supply to become “Overflowing.” Pay special attention to changes in the market when looking to create a large amount of a single kind of handicraft.","","","False","0x0000030D","",""

"","Mastering the intricacies of isleworks production and trade begins with a close examination of the materials available to you and the strategic implementation of efficiency bonuses.

For those islekeeps who feel like they have a firm grasp on the basics, the following tips will help you take your island industry─and earnings─to the next level.


■Popular Items Sell Even Better When Scarce
When a handicraft has High or Very High popularity, the inclination may be to produce large quantities of it, as popularity increases selling price. However, simply selling lots of a popular item will result in Overflowing supply for future cycles, which may ultimately undercut potential earnings.

By waiting to sell a popular handicraft during cycles in which its supply is Nonexistent, you can optimize your profits while keeping the markets in balance.

Demand Shift may prove a helpful indicator of how supply levels will behave in coming cycles. For example, if an Insufficient handicraft is showing a Skyrocketing demand shift, one might reasonably expect it to reach Nonexistent supply by the following cycle.


■Start the Season Short and Efficient
Levels of groove increase with the number of efficiency bonuses activated during production. Therefore, securing as many efficiency bonuses as you can at the beginning of a season allows you to benefit from the effects of maximum groove for longer.

To quickly activate efficiency bonsues, schedule applicable handicrafts that require relatively short production times. Handicrafts that take longer to produce typically fetch a higher price, so waiting to create these items until groove is high will maximize your earnings without flooding supply.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Strategically utilizing factors such as groove and paying close attention to production time will help increase the value of the handicrafts you sell.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>","","","False","0x00000312","",""

"","With an agenda in hand and a team of eager mammets at your disposal, you are free to make any and all handicrafts your heart desires. However, a very special bonus awaits those who choose their schedules cleverly.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>The efficiency bonus will double the production of a given handicraft without requiring additional materials or production time.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>

Doubling the production of a handicraft means you will have two handicrafts to export, and basic mathematics tells us that two handicrafts will sell for twice as much as one handicraft will. So what are you waiting for? Activate those efficiency bonuses by following the steps below!

■Activating Efficiency Bonuses
All handicrafts belong to at least one item category, such as “Concoctions” or “Confections.”

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Efficiency bonuses are activated by scheduling the production of similarly categorized items in direct succession.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>

For example, an isleworks potion and isleworks firesand are both classified as “Concoctions.” By scheduling production of isleworks firesand right after your isleworks potion, you will activate an efficiency bonus that creates two pinches of isleworks firesand with the same time and materials it would normally take to make one!

But you don't have to keep track of all your bonuses in that steel-trap mind of yours─the text “Efficiency Bonus!” will appear on the agenda for items that will be produced twice as a result of your clever scheduling.","","","False","0x00000315","",""
"","But wait! There's more.

What if you scheduled an isleworks potion, followed by a pinch of isleworks firesand, followed by <var 1A 02 /var>another<var 1A 01 /var> isleworks potion?

Thanks to efficiency bonuses, what might have been only three handicrafts has now been expanded to five! Think of the profits! Keep in mind both the type and order of handicrafts you add to your agenda, and you will be swimming in an abundance of seafarer's cowries in no time.

■Limitations of the Efficiency Bonus
Unfortunately, due to the peculiarities of the mammet's psyche, your tiny workers will not be nearly as excited making the same item twice in a row. While an isleworks potion/isleworks firesand combination will earn you an efficiency bonus, an order of isleworks potion/isleworks potion will get you nothing but some blinking and basic adherence to general protocol.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>In other words, only different items belonging to the same category can activate efficiency bonuses.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>

When aiming for bonuses, be sure you are scheduling different handicrafts. Variety, after all, is the spice of island life.","Но подождите! Это ещё не всё.

Что, если вы запланировали isleworks potion, затем щепотку isleworks firesand, затем <var 1A 02 /var>снова<var 1A 01 /var> isleworks potion?

Благодаря бонусам к эффективности, то, что могло быть всего тремя изделиями, теперь станет пятью! Представляете, какая будет прибыль! Следите за типом и порядком изделий, которые вы добавляете в свою программу, и вы в мгновение ока будете купаться в изобилии seafarer's cowries.

■Ограничения бонуса эффективности
К сожалению, из-за особенностей психики мамметов ваши крошечные работники не будут с таким же удовольствием делать один и тот же предмет два раза подряд. Комбинация isleworks potion и isleworks firesand принесёт вам бонус к эффективности, в то время как заказ isleworks potion и isleworks potion не даст вам ничего, кроме стресса у ваших мамметов.
