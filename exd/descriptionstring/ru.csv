A Frontline alliance consists of 24 members, divided into 3 full parties. There are 3 alliances, which combine for a total of 72 participants.
A match lasts for 20 minutes.

■Retaliation
Incapacitated players will be returned to their Grand Company's landing, where they will be allowed to rejoin combat after a short delay. This will not incur a weakness penalty.
Furthermore, players will be temporarily invulnerable when leaving their Grand Company's landing.

■Mounts
Players are free to use mounts during Frontline campaigns. However, players taking damage while mounted will be afflicted with the Limp status effect.

■Return
Using Return will teleport players back to their landing point. Moreover, this action has no recast time during Frontline campaigns. Please note, however, casting will be interrupted by attacks.

■KDA
Each time a player incapacitates an enemy player, they are awarded a knockout (K). When a player is incapacitated, they are classed as “down” (D). If a player deals damage to an enemy that is then incapacitated by a teammate, they are awarded an assist (A). The final K, D, and A for each player is displayed on the results screen at the end of the battle.

To begin, enable Feed mode from the islekeep's index, then approach an animal in the pasture equipped with the feed item of your choice to give it the tasty treat it deserves.

Feeding an animal will improve its mood and sate its appetite.

■Feed
There are three different types of animal feed available:
island sweetfeed, island greenfeed, and premium island greenfeed.

Each feed can be crafted via the Sanctuary Crafting Log, and both types of greenfeed require produce yielded from the cropland.

■Food
Animals have the following four stages of appetite:
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>“Stuffed,” “Satisfied,” “Hungry,” and “Starving.”<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
An animal's appetite increases with time, and its mood worsens in parallel.

Any type of feed can satiate an animal until it is stuffed, and animals cannot be fed if already stuffed.

■Mood
Animals have the following five moods:
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>“Hostile,” “Unhappy,” “Content,” “Chipper,” and “Gleeful.”<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
When an animal is starving, its mood will become hostile. Nourish animals in your care with food to improve their mood, and you may gather more leavings─among other boons!─in return.

Unlike appetite, an animal's mood is affected by the type of feed given to it.

・Island Sweetfeed

Кормление животного улучшит его настроение и утолит аппетит.

■Корм
Существует три различных типа корма для животных:
островной сладкий корм, островной зеленый корм и премиальный островной зеленый корм.

Каждый вид корма можно изготовить через журнал ремесел в святилище, а для изготовления обоих видов корма требуются продукты, получаемые с пахотных земель.

■Еда
Животные имеют следующие четыре стадии аппетита:
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var> «Сытый», «Удовлетворенный», «Голодный» и ""Страдающий».<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
Аппетит животного со временем увеличивается, параллельно ухудшается и его настроение.

Любой вид корма может насытить животное, пока оно не наестся, а если животное уже наелось, его нельзя накормить.

■Настроение
У животных есть следующие пять настроений:
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var> «Враждебное», «Недовольное», «Довольное», «Бодрое» и «Радостное». <var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
Когда животное голодает, его настроение становится враждебным. Накормите животных, находящихся на вашем попечении, едой, чтобы улучшить их настроение, и вы сможете получить взамен больше материалов!

В отличие от аппетита, на настроение животного влияет вид корма, который ему дают.

"","Mastering the intricacies of isleworks production and trade begins with a close examination of the materials available to you and the strategic implementation of efficiency bonuses.

For those islekeeps who feel like they have a firm grasp on the basics, the following tips will help you take your island industry─and earnings─to the next level.


■Popular Items Sell Even Better When Scarce
When a handicraft has High or Very High popularity, the inclination may be to produce large quantities of it, as popularity increases selling price. However, simply selling lots of a popular item will result in Overflowing supply for future cycles, which may ultimately undercut potential earnings.

By waiting to sell a popular handicraft during cycles in which its supply is Nonexistent, you can optimize your profits while keeping the markets in balance.

Demand Shift may prove a helpful indicator of how supply levels will behave in coming cycles. For example, if an Insufficient handicraft is showing a Skyrocketing demand shift, one might reasonably expect it to reach Nonexistent supply by the following cycle.


■Start the Season Short and Efficient
Levels of groove increase with the number of efficiency bonuses activated during production. Therefore, securing as many efficiency bonuses as you can at the beginning of a season allows you to benefit from the effects of maximum groove for longer.

To quickly activate efficiency bonsues, schedule applicable handicrafts that require relatively short production times. Handicrafts that take longer to produce typically fetch a higher price, so waiting to create these items until groove is high will maximize your earnings without flooding supply.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Strategically utilizing factors such as groove and paying close attention to production time will help increase the value of the handicrafts you sell.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>","Освоение тонкостей производства и торговли на островах начинается с внимательного изучения доступных вам материалов и стратегического применения бонусов эффективности.

Для тех владельцев островов, которые чувствуют, что они твёрдо знают основы, следующие советы помогут вам вывести свою островную промышленность, и соответственно доходы на новый уровень.


Популярные предметы продаются ещё лучше, когда они в дефиците
Когда ремесло пользуется высокой или очень высокой популярностью, возникает желание производить его в больших количествах, поскольку популярность повышает цену продажи. Однако просто продажа большого количества популярного товара приведёт к переполнению предложения для будущих циклов, что в конечном итоге может снизить потенциальный доход.

Подождав с продажей популярного ремесла во время циклов, в которых его предложение отсутствует, вы сможете оптимизировать свою прибыль, сохраняя баланс на рынках.

Сдвиг спроса может оказаться полезным индикатором того, как поведёт себя уровень предложения в предстоящих циклах. Например, если ремесло с недостаточным спросом демонстрирует скачкообразный рост спроса, то можно вполне обоснованно ожидать, что к следующему циклу его предложение достигнет несуществующего уровня.


■ Начинайте сезон быстро и эффективно
Уровень линии производства увеличивается с количеством бонусов эффективности, активированных во время производства. Поэтому, если в начале сезона вы активируете как можно больше бонусов эффективности, вы сможете дольше пользоваться максимальным эффектом слотов на линии.

Чтобы быстро активировать бонусы эффективности, планируйте изготовку изделий, требующие относительно короткого времени производства. Ремесленные изделия, на производство которых требуется больше времени, обычно стоят дороже, поэтому, если подождать с их созданием до наступления высокого уровня линии производства, вы сможете получить максимальный доход, не перегружая предложение.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Стратегическое использование таких факторов, как правильное распределение на линии производства, и пристальное внимание к времени помогут увеличить стоимость продаваемых вами изделий.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>.","","False","0x00000312","",""

"","With an agenda in hand and a team of eager mammets at your disposal, you are free to make any and all handicrafts your heart desires. However, a very special bonus awaits those who choose their schedules cleverly.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>The efficiency bonus will double the production of a given handicraft without requiring additional materials or production time.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>

Doubling the production of a handicraft means you will have two handicrafts to export, and basic mathematics tells us that two handicrafts will sell for twice as much as one handicraft will. So what are you waiting for? Activate those efficiency bonuses by following the steps below!

■Activating Efficiency Bonuses
All handicrafts belong to at least one item category, such as “Concoctions” or “Confections.”

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Efficiency bonuses are activated by scheduling the production of similarly categorized items in direct succession.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>

For example, an isleworks potion and isleworks firesand are both classified as “Concoctions.” By scheduling production of isleworks firesand right after your isleworks potion, you will activate an efficiency bonus that creates two pinches of isleworks firesand with the same time and materials it would normally take to make one!

But you don't have to keep track of all your bonuses in that steel-trap mind of yours─the text “Efficiency Bonus!” will appear on the agenda for items that will be produced twice as a result of your clever scheduling.","Имея на руках план действий и команду нетерпеливых мамметов, вы можете свободно мастерить любые поделки, какие только пожелает ваша душа. Однако тех, кто грамотно выберет своё расписание, ждёт особый бонус.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Бонус эффективности удвоит производство данного ремесла, не требуя дополнительных материалов или времени на производство.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>.

Удвоение производства ремесла означает, что у вас будет два изделия вместо одного для экспорта, а элементарная математика говорит нам, это и продаваться будет в два раза дороже, чем одно изделие. Так чего же вы ждёте? Активируйте бонусы эффективности, выполнив следующие шаги!

■Активация бонусов эффективности
Все ремёсла принадлежат хотя бы к одной категории предметов, например, «Продукты» или «Кондитерские изделия».

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Бонусы эффективности активируются при планировании производства предметов, относящихся к одной категории, в прямой последовательности.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>.

Например, «островное зелье» и «островной порох» классифицируются как «Медицина». Запланировав производство «островного пороха» сразу после изготовления «островного зелья», вы активируете бонус эффективности, который позволит создать две щепотки «островного пороха» за то же время и те же материалы, которые обычно требуются для изготовления одной порции!

Но вам не нужно отслеживать все бонусы в своём разуме, так как текст «Бонус эффективности!» появится на повестке дня для предметов, которые будут произведены дважды в результате вашего умного планирования.","","False","0x00000315","",""
"","But wait! There's more.

What if you scheduled an isleworks potion, followed by a pinch of isleworks firesand, followed by <var 1A 02 /var>another<var 1A 01 /var> isleworks potion?

■Limitations of the Efficiency Bonus
Unfortunately, due to the peculiarities of the mammet's psyche, your tiny workers will not be nearly as excited making the same item twice in a row. While an isleworks potion/isleworks firesand combination will earn you an efficiency bonus, an order of isleworks potion/isleworks potion will get you nothing but some blinking and basic adherence to general protocol.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>In other words, only different items belonging to the same category can activate efficiency bonuses.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>

When aiming for bonuses, be sure you are scheduling different handicrafts. Variety, after all, is the spice of island life.","Но подождите! Это ещё не всё.

Что, если вы запланировали островное зелье, затем щепотку островного пороха, затем <var 1A 02 /var>снова<var 1A 01 /var> островное зелье?

■Ограничения бонуса эффективности
