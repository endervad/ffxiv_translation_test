  You and your opponent each have three of these immobile crystals on
  the playing field. Shatter all of your enemy's Arcana Stones to claim
  victory.
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Gates<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
  Minions will appear in front of your currently selected gate.
  Returning minions to a gate area will restore their HP.
  Minions can still be summoned from a destroyed gate, but they will be
  unable to exit the gate area. Conversely, minions outside a destroyed
  gate will be unable to enter.
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Search Eye<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
  This structure reveals your opponent's minions. If the Search Eye is
  destroyed, you will only be able to see enemy units that are near
  your own minions.
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Shield<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
  This structure adds defensive strength to Arcana Stones. Destroy the
  enemy Shield and your opponent's Arcana Stones will be more easily
  shattered.

<var 48 F201F4 /var><var 49 F201F5 /var>Structural Regeneration<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
  All structures except for Arcana Stones can only be temporarily
  destroyed. Their various functions will reactivate at full strength
  after a certain amount of time has passed.
  ※Positioning your minions near a destroyed structure will hasten
  　the reactivation process.

<var 48 F201F4 /var><var 49 F201F5 /var>Play to Your Minions' Strengths<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
  Each variety of minion is capable of inflicting greater damage against
  certain structures. Learn each unit's strengths, and pick the right
  minion for the job!

<var 48 F201F4 /var><var 49 F201F5 /var>Turn the Tide with Special Actions<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
  These conditions must be met before a special action can be used:
  ・Four minions of the same variety are gathered in an action party
  ・Each minion in the action party has full action points
   (Action points accumulate over time)
  To perform a special action, select an individual minion from the
  action party, and press the Execute Action button on the minion
  hotbar.

<var 48 F201F4 /var><var 49 F201F5 /var>Mastering Traps<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
  Some minions will place traps with their special actions. A trap will
  become armed ten seconds after it has been placed, and it can then
  be triggered by pressing the Trigger Trap button on the minion
  hotbar.
  ※Only one trap can be placed at a time.
