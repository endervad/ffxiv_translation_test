"","<var 48 F20202 /var>Progress Record<var 48 01 /var>
Progress within the latest Savage raids is
periodically saved, allowing for continuation
of the duty from that point.

Progress is reset every week on
<var 06 1203 /var><var 09 DD ((Sunday)) ((Monday)) ((Tuesday)) ((Wednesday)) ((Thursday)) ((Friday)) ((Saturday)) /var> at <var 08 DB ((<var 09 DB02030405060708090A0B0C0D02030405060708090A0B0C /var>)) 0D /var> <var 08 E0DB0D ((p.m.)) ((a.m.)) /var> (Earth time).

<var 48 F20202 /var>Party Progress<var 48 01 /var>
A party's starting point in the raid is
determined by the leader's past progress.
As long as all other conditions are met, 
players who have not progressed as far as
the leader may still participate in the duty.

If a party member's progress was less
than that of the leader, then progress
will be updated to match.

If a party member's progress is beyond
that of the leader, that member's progress
will remain unaffected.

<var 48 F20202 /var>Reward Restrictions<var 48 01 /var>
Players will not earn rewards for completing
phases they have already completed.
Coffer quantity will vary based on the total
number of party members who have already
completed the duty.

When participating in the latest Savage raid
with a matched party, duty rewards may
change based on the progress level of
matched members.

<var 48 F20202 /var>Job Distribution<var 48 01 /var>
Parties formed with the Raid Finder do not
allow for two members with the same job
unless certain conditions are met.

DPS jobs are divided into the following roles:
Melee DPS, Physical Ranged DPS,
Magical Ranged DPS, and Not Specified.

When the raid purpose is set as “Duty Completion,”
the jobs that fall into Not Specified must be
different from the ones which fill the other three
DPS roles. When the raid purpose is set to “Practice,”
overlapping between specified and unspecified DPS
jobs is allowed.

<var 48 F20202 /var>Loot Rules & Languages<var 48 01 /var>
Loot rules and Language settings are imported
from current Duty Finder settings.

Если в качестве цели рейда установлено «Практика», то одинаковые профессии у чётко и нечётко обозначенных ролей бойцов допустимы.

У групп, сформированных через Поиск рейдов, не может быть больше одного pure healer и barrier healer соответственно.
　・Pure Healers: White Mage, Astrologian

If a party member's progress was less than that of the leader, then progress will be updated to match.
If a party member's progress is beyond that of the leader, that member's progress will remain unaffected.

Should you wish to try your luck, two cards will appear─one hidden, one revealed─with a possible value of one to nine. You must then guess whether the value of the hidden card is higher or lower than that of the other.
・If you guess correctly, the quantity of items you may claim will increase.
・You may elect to try your luck again following a correct guess, up to a maximum of five times.
・If you guess incorrectly at any point, the coffer will vanish, and you will lose all treasure.
・If the number is the same, the quantity of items you may claim will remain unchanged, and you will have to try your luck again. This will not count against the five-time maximum.
・To claim the treasure within, you need only resist the Gambler's Lure and open the chest...","Этот сундук с сокровищами дал вам доступ к мини-игре «Gambler's Lure»!
Если вы захотите испытать удачу, появятся две карты: одна скрытая, другая раскрытая. Их значение может разниться от 1 до 9. Вам потребуется угадать, выше значение скрытой карты или ниже.
・Если вы угадаете правильно, количество получаемых предметов будет увеличено.
・После правильной попытки вы можете ещё раз повторить до 5 раз.
・Если вы в любой момент неправильно угадаете, сундук исчезнет и вы потеряете всю добычу.
・Если число окажется таким же, то количество предметов не изменится и вам нужно будет попробовать ещё раз. Эта попытка не будет засчитана.
・Чтобы получить сокровища, вам нужно просто не поддаться азарту и открыть сундук...","","False","0x00002C93","",""

Any player can create a cross-world linkshell, as well as join one via invite. While communication between players on the same world is possible through cross-world linkshells, it is recommended that intraworld communication is done using normal linkshells available in Limsa Lominsa, Gridania, and Ul'dah.

Cross-world linkshell channel order can be changed via list subcommands. This information is saved to the client, so if you plan on utilizing multiple play environments, it is highly recommended you save the data using the settings backup feature.

Please note, players may belong to up to eight cross-world linkshells at a time, and linkshells with less than 2 active members will be automatically disbanded if new members are not added within 24 hours (Earth time). Multiple cross-world linkshells cannot be created in succession.","<var 48 F201F8 /var><var 49 F201F9 /var>Cross-world linkshell'ы<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var> — это особые linkshell'ы, которые позволяют игрокам из разных миров создавать приватные чат-группы и общаться в реальном времени. Любой игрок может как создать cross-world linkshell, так и присоединиться к существующему по приглашению. Несмотря на то, что общение между игроками в одном мире возможно через cross-world linkshell, рекомендуется использовать для этого обычные linkshell'ы. Они доступы в Limsa Lominsa, Gridania и Ul'dah.

Порядок cross-world linkshell'ов можно менять через подкоманды. Он сохраняется в клиенте, так что если вы собираетесь играть в нескольких местах, рекомендуем сохранять данные функцией резервного копирования настроек.

Обратите внимание, что игроки могут быть одновременно в не более 8 cross-world linkshell'ов. Также если в одном из них меньше 2 человек, linkshell будет автоматически распущен. Это можно предотвратить, добавив в него другого игрока в течение 24 часов (по реальному времени). Нельзя создать несколько cross-world linkshell'ов подряд.","","True","0x00002F56","",""
