<var 48 F20202 /var>Party Progress<var 48 01 /var>
A party's starting point in the raid is
determined by the leader's past progress.
As long as all other conditions are met, 
players who have not progressed as far as
the leader may still participate in the duty.

If a party member's progress was less
than that of the leader, then progress
will be updated to match.

If a party member's progress is beyond
that of the leader, that member's progress
will remain unaffected.

<var 48 F20202 /var>Reward Restrictions<var 48 01 /var>
Players will not earn rewards for completing
phases they have already completed.
Coffer quantity will vary based on the total
number of party members who have already
completed the duty.

When participating in the latest Savage raid
with a matched party, duty rewards may
change based on the progress level of
matched members.

<var 48 F20202 /var>Job Distribution<var 48 01 /var>
Parties formed with the Raid Finder do not
allow for two members with the same job
unless certain conditions are met.

DPS jobs are divided into the following roles:
Melee DPS, Physical Ranged DPS,
Magical Ranged DPS, and Not Specified.

When the raid purpose is set as “Duty Completion,”
the jobs that fall into Not Specified must be
different from the ones which fill the other three
DPS roles. When the raid purpose is set to “Practice,”
overlapping between specified and unspecified DPS
jobs is allowed.
