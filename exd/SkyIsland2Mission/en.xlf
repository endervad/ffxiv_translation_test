The land has undergone dramatic transformations, and we seek adventurers to conduct sweeping surveys and report on newly available resources. Mining, harvesting, fishing─gather the Diadem's bounty by whichever means you wish, and fear not that we will tax the riches you claim. We care only for the knowledge you uncover.

We ask that you begin with the usual business of hunting the isles' denizens. But should the egg-devouring rodents surface, pray make haste to their location─the prize we seek cannot be far away. Slay the mice, secure the egg, then convey it to the designated collection point.
