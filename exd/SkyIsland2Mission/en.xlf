        <target state="final">Operation Landsweep&lt;tab&gt;Ever since a vagrant ruin drifted into the vicinity of the Diadem, the elemental balance of the isles has fallen into chaos. The land has undergone dramatic transformations, and we seek adventurers to conduct sweeping surveys and report on newly available resources. Mining, harvesting, fishing─gather the Diadem's bounty by whichever means you wish, and fear not that we will tax the riches you claim. We care only for the knowledge you uncover.
