"","Operation Lethal Attraction<tab>During our explorations throughout the Diadem, we have discovered that the scents emitted by certain species are effective in attracting many of the isles' predators. House Haillenarte's alchemists believe that they can mix these scents to concoct an all-purpose lure, and thus greatly improve the efficiency of our hunting parties. Track down two of the more potent-smelling examples, and harvest from them the substances our alchemists require.

We ask that you begin with the usual business of hunting the isles' denizens. But should the egg-devouring rodents surface, pray make haste to their location─the prize we seek cannot be far away. Slay the mice, secure the egg, then convey it to the designated collection point.
